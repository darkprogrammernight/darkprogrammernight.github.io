Abstract Skin conductance responses (SCR) are an established component of the
psychological methods toolkit, and increasingly popular in neuroeconomics. This
chapter discusses how SCR are generated by the sympathetic nervous system, the
underlying central processes, and provides practical guidelines for SCR research.
These guidelines are based on the existing methodological literature and recom-
mendations by the Society for Psychophysiological Research. Analysis strategies
for SCR are presented in the light of contemporary, model-based approaches that
yield optimal statistical power to make inference on central states. The chapter then
gives an overview over applications of SCR in neuroeconomics and outlines current
research directions. Because emotional, cognitive, and motor processes can all elicit
SCR, interpretation in economic experiments is sometimes challenging. It is
therefore recommended to experimentally control possible cognitive and motor
confounds. Finally, it would be useful to complement SCR with other peripheral
measures of sympathetic/parasympathetic activity, in particular heart period and
pupil size.



18.1     Background

Sweat glands primarily serve thermoregulation. However, as many people have
experienced during exams, sweating in some parts of the body increases under
particular states of affective or cognitive arousal. This has been termed ‘emotional
sweating’ and occurs especially in palmar, plantar, facial, genital and axillary
regions (Boucsein 2012). Palms and soles have received most scientiﬁc interest, as
they are easy to access. Across the body, sweat glands are innervated by sympa-
thetic—and to a very limited extent, parasympathetic—nerve ﬁbres. From their end

terminals, acetylcholine is released as transmitter and diffuses locally to reach the
sweat glands. These nerves are termed sudomotor as they drive the sweat glands,
and are orchestrated by the hypothalamus, which thereby controls thermoregula-
tion, in line with a general function in maintaining homeostasis. For control of
emotional sweating in particular, the hypothalamus is an output relay under control
of higher subcortical and cortical areas (Boucsein 2012; Critchley 2002).
    Changes in sweat expulsion can be easily measured by recording the conduc-
tance of the skin. In a nutshell, more sweat means more electrolytes which results in
lower resistance. Commonly, conductance is reported, i.e. the reciprocal of resis-
tance. Different indicators of emotional sweating have been developed; two are
widely used. One is the amplitude of short, phasic conductance increases with 1-2 s
latency to an event, and 30–60 s duration; these are usually termed event-related or
evoked skin conductance responses (SCR). SCR are regarded as indicators of
event-related arousal. When SCR occur spontaneously in the absence of external
events, they are called spontaneous fluctuations (SF) or non-speciﬁc SCR (NS.
SCR), and their number per time unit (nSF) is a common measure of tonic arousal
(Boucsein 2012). SCR and SF have a roughly similar shape (see Fig. 18.1).1
    Phasic SCR are elicited by a wide range of stimuli, including pain, emotionally
arousing (positive and negative) stimuli, events requiring cognitive resources, or
motor actions. Equally, SF is observed in various situations, including anticatory
anxiety and mental load. The reader is referred to Boucsein (2012) for an in-depth
review. Thus, there is no speciﬁc cognitive process causing SCR.
    One may relate the amplitude of event-related SCR, or the number of SF, to a
state of the sudomotor (sympathetic) nervous system, which we have termed
(phasic or tonic) ‘sympathetic arousal’ (Bach and Friston 2013). It is currently not
precisely known whether sympathetic arousal is globally regulated, or whether
arousal is speciﬁc to sympathetic subsystems such as the sudomotor system.2
Sympathetic arousal is a descriptive but useful construct: it relates more directly to
psychological processes that elicit it than the observed SCR themselves. This is
because the latter are also influenced by a number of peripheral factors that induce
measurement noise. Contemporary model-based analysis methods seek to estimate
sympathetic arousal from observed data, and relate these estimates to experimental
manipulations, as reviewed in Bach and Friston (2013). In the ﬁeld of behavioural
economics, research on what elicits sympathetic arousal is ongoing, and is reviewed
in the ﬁnal part of this chapter.

 Further measures of tonic arousal include the tonic skin conductance level (SCL) and area under
the curve (AUC) which I will not discuss in this chapter—interested readers are referred to (Bach
et al. 2010c; Boucsein 2012).

 The fact that SCR indices can dissociate from heart rate might indicate that there is no global
sympathetic arousal (Boucsein 2012); but the heart rate is under control of the parasympathetic
system as well.

Fig. 18.1 a Shape of a typical skin conductance response after band-pass ﬁltering. This canonical
shape was derived from 1278 phasic SCR in 64 individuals (Bach et al. 2010b). b Example for a
skin conductance time series. This is a 60 s data segment from an experiment involving public
speaking anticipation (Bach and Erdmann 2007). c From the observed skin conductance time
series, the (unobservable) sudomotor nerve activity can be estimated. The example here used a
model for spontaneous fluctuations (SF), which speciﬁes that sudomotor activity occurs in a ﬁnite
number of compact bursts. One can see that the ensuing sudomotor nerve time series has a higher
temporal resolution: for example, the ﬁrst bump in the skin conductance time series is likely to be
caused by two subsequent bursts of sudomotor ﬁring. Tonic sympathetic arousal, the underlying
unobservable construct, can now be quantiﬁed as the number of sudomotor bursts per time unit


18.2     Methodology

The methodology of acquiring SCR is fairly standard nowadays; interested readers
are referred to Boucsein (2012) for technical details and recent developments, and
to Boucsein et al. (2012) for current recommendations by the Society for
Psychophysiological Research (SPR). Exosomatic DC recording is the most
348                                                                                  D.R. Bach

commonly used method in the ﬁeld. A constant voltage is applied to the skin, and
the ensuing direct current (DC) measured.3 Resistance (R), conductance (G),
voltage (V) and current (I) are related by Ohm’s law:

                                            V
                                       I¼     ¼V G
                                            R

   Hence, when applying a constant voltage to the skin—typically between 0.5 and
3 V, a change in resistance/conductance leads to a change in the measured DC.
Most measurement devices record voltage, such that a coupler is used to translate
current into voltage—typically nowadays by a differential ampliﬁer. From the
recorded voltage, the underlying skin conductance can be inferred. The relationship
between conductance and output voltage is linear in most couplers unless one uses
resistive electrodes—for example in MRI environments—such that the series
resistance RS has to be taken into account. Also it is important to note if there exists
an offset voltage (for example, for optical transduction in MRI environment). The
transfer function—the relation between measured voltage and underlying skin
conductance—is given by

                                                   1
                                     G¼        c
                                            Voffset
                                                       R

   Here, c is a transfer constant of the coupler that determines the factor by which
the measured conductance is multiplied by the device to yield the output voltage.
When there is no series resistor and no offset, this collapses to

                                                   V
                                            G¼
                                                   c

   If the transfer function is linear (i.e. in the absence of series resistors), it is
possible to analyse the output data of the coupler without knowledge of the transfer
function, and report results in arbitrary units. However, it is good practice to report
results in conductance units and this is mandatory when absolute cutoff values are
used (for example for counting nSF). Sometimes, the coupler sensitivity is adjusted
to individual SCL, such that each individual might have a different transfer
function.
   Palm and sole possess the highest density of sweat glands responding to
non-thermoregulatory central influences, with no difference in SCR shape (Bach
et al. 2010b). Typical measurement sites are thenar/hypothenar, or medial/distal
phalanges of two different ﬁngers—distal phalanges show higher SCR (Boucsein


3
 This is different from the infrequently used methods of endosomatic recording, which measures
the skin potential response (SPR) without applying an external voltage, and from exosomatic
measurements with alternating voltage, measuring alternating current (AC). A further method, not
recommended by the SPR, is to use constant current, measuring voltage.

2012). If both hands are needed to make responses, or in a magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) scanner, it might be useful to record from the inner arch of the foot
(Boucsein 2012). According to consensus guidelines, there is no need to pre-treat
the recording sites; in particular, no soap should be used. For theoretical reasons
and out of practical considerations, it is recommended to use Ag/AgCl cup elec-
trodes ﬁlled with skin-isotonic gel (usually 0.3–0.5 % NaCl) (Hygge and Hugdahl
1985). There is no recommendation on electrode size; standard electrodes available
from lab equipment providers are 6–10 mm in diameter. In between-subject
designs, it is important to keep electrode type, size, gel and ambient
temperature/humidity constant, as these can influence measurements (Boucsein
2012).



18.3     Data Acquisition and Preprocessing

Traditionally, it was standard to ﬁlter analogue data before conversion to a digital
signal, in order to allow low sampling rates and to reduce the dynamic range of
responses. Contemporary acquisition systems with large dynamic range and cheap
memory make this strategy dispensable, and allow for direct A/D-conversion and
storage of raw data. When unﬁltered data are A/D-converted, it is important to
choose a sampling frequency generously higher than the signal of interest—to
reduce aliasing of high noise frequencies. The signal of interest is in a frequency
range below 5 Hz, and 100 Hz would be a typical sampling rate. Filters can then be
applied digitally (see below).
   After data acquisition, it is useful to visually inspect the time series for artefacts.
In practice, subject motion, loose electrodes, and equipment malfunction often
cause artefacts. In fMRI environments, two additional sources of artefacts are
gradient noise and currents induced by subject motion in the static ﬁeld. The ﬁrst
usually has a high frequency and is therefore easier to ﬁlter out. Subject motion in
the static ﬁeld is a more important concern and should be minimized by restricting
subject motion and ﬁxing wires wherever possible. It is current practice to
band-pass ﬁlter the data before analysis. A typical low-pass cutoff would be 5 Hz,
to reduce high-frequency noise and allow downsampling to 10 Hz. A typical
high-pass cutoff is 0.015 Hz, in order to reduce slow signal drifts. Model-based
analysis prefers slightly different ﬁlters (Bach et al. 2013; Staib et al. 2015).



18.4     Analysis

Traditionally, researchers used paper-and-pencil approaches to measure the
amplitude of SCR peaks in a post-stimulus time-window, or to count SF over a
period of time (Boucsein 2012). This approach makes the assumption that SCR
350                                                                         D.R. Bach

occur in a particular post-stimulus window, and that their peak amplitude or number
is at least monotonically related to a psychological process of interest. Early
computerized analysis packages softwares emulated this strategy. Over the last two
decades, more sophisticated methods emerged. A practical motivation was that
developments in cognitive neuroscience often mandated rapid event-related
experimental designs. SCR have a long tail (about 30–60 s) such that they over-
lap in such circumstances (Barry et al. 1993). This has lead to the development of
model-based methods (Alexander et al. 2005; Bach et al. 2009, 2010a, b, c, 2011;
Benedek and Kaernbach 2010a, b; Lim et al. 1997). These methods estimate, by
different algorithms, the underlying sudomotor nerve activity, which offers a higher
temporal resolution and makes peak separation easier. It turned out that causal
models of this sort have a number of more fundamental advantages over traditional
data analysis (Bach and Friston 2013).
    In particular, any ‘operational’ deﬁnition of dependent measures makes
assumptions. To neuroeconomists, SCR are not interesting by themselves, but
because they relate to central processes. The precise relation between SCR and
central processes is not precisely speciﬁed in operational approaches, and
assumptions on this relation may vary from publication to publication. Specifying
these implicit assumptions mathematically in a causal model has two important
consequences: ﬁrst, it is then possible to empirically test the assumptions. Second,
we can now infer the central process quantitatively by model inversion. This allows
the experimenter to test quantitative relationships of this central process with other
variables—asking, for example, whether outcome variance or entropy better
explains sympathetic arousal.
    A major faultline runs between two particular model-based approaches (Bach
and Friston 2013). The ﬁrst one contains only a mapping from sudomotor nerve
activity to skin conductance (peripheral model). Algorithms using this approach
deterministically compute a time series of sudomotor activity directly from
observed SCR. This sudomotor time series does not directly relate to the experiment
and needs to be further analysed using peak-scoring methods (Alexander et al.
2005; Benedek and Kaernbach 2010a, b). A freely available software representing
this approach is Ledalab. The second approach contains a peripheral model and a
neural model—the latter constraining what sudomotor activity to expect in a given
experiment. Probabilistic algorithms then estimate the most likely parameters of the
neural model, given the data and a sudomotor model (Bach et al. 2009, 2010b,
2011; Bach and Staib 2015). This is similar to standard methods for fMRI analysis
(see Chap. 20). The software PsPM (Psychophysiological Modelling) represents
this approach.
    Probabilistic model-based methods offer a further advantage over traditional
peak-scoring methods: higher precision. For example, specifying a neural model of
when to expect SCR, renders estimation of SCR amplitude more precise.
Sympathetic arousal estimates from probabilistic approaches have been shown to
separate different experimental conditions better than peak-scoring (Bach 2014;
Bach et al. 2013; Staib et al. 2015), and also better than deterministic methods, such
18   Skin Conductance Measures in Neuroeconomic Research                          351

as Ledalab (Bach 2014; Green et al. 2014). In the following, I will refer only to
methods using probabilistic model inversion.
    Crucially, probabilistic model inversion is the process of ﬁnding the most likely
parameters of a model, given some data and some prior knowledge. The goal of this
procedure is not to precisely explain the observed SCR data using many parameters.
Instead, the method establishes plausible estimates of sympathetic arousal and
ignores variance that is presumably not caused by experimental manipulation.
Therefore, probabilistic model inversion uses, to varying degree, information about
the experimental timing, and plausible prior assumptions about the sudomotor
system. It is therefore important to think about what model to use and what
information to give to the model inversion process. The more information the
model has about known causes of sudomotor nerve responses, the more precise the
estimated sympathetic arousal estimates will be.
    Because probabilistic models aim to incorporate as much knowledge as possible
into the model without being biased with respect to research hypotheses, there are
different models for different situations. Phasic sympathetic arousal causes short
ﬁring bursts of the sudomotor nerve (SN). On a practical level, one needs to
distinguish two cases. One is when SN ﬁring occurs with constant latency after a
short (<1 s) stimulus—we have termed this ‘evoked SN responses’, and the ensuing
peripheral responses ‘evoked SCR’. Phasic arousal corresponds to the amplitude of
the SN response and can be estimated in a general linear convolution framework
under the assumption of a constant latency (Bach et al. 2009, 2010b, 2013), much
like in fMRI analysis (see Chap. 20). Another situation is when SN responses are
elicited by experimental events, but their onset is not precisely known and needs to
be estimated, too. Such event-related SN responses can be modelled using nonlinear
methods; we have implemented this in the inversion framework of dynamic causal
modelling (often used to estimate effective connectivity, an altogether different
application) (Bach et al. 2010a; Staib et al. 2015). Tonic sympathetic arousal, on the
other hand, can be quantiﬁed as the number of SN responses per time unit.
Estimation of this number has been implemented in the inversion framework of
dynamic causal modelling (Bach et al. 2011), or as a computationally faster
alternative, with a matching pursuit algorithm (Bach and Staib 2015).



18.5     Neuroeconomic Research: The ‘Somatic Marker
         Hypothesis’ and Beyond

Traditionally, SCR and SF have been used in the study of emotion and rein-
forcement learning, and in applied and clinical psychology. In the context of
neuroeconomics, one application is therefore to infer emotional influences on
value-based decisions. An important proposal for such research has been the
352                                                                          D.R. Bach

‘somatic marker hypothesis’ (SMH). It is discussed here because it has generated a
wave of SCR research in economic decision-making.
    The SMH states that decisions are guided by preconscious signals elicited by
each contemplated choice option (Damasio 1994). These signals are conveyed to
the decision-making system by a mechanism that orchestrates particular bodily
states, so called ‘somatic markers’. These somatic markers are perceived by the
decision-making system and preconsciously bias a decision into the right direction
before conscious knowledge on the best strategy is formed. This means, instead of
directly wiring the preconscious signal to the decision-making system, this signal
takes a loop over a somatic state. In rehearsed situations, the anticipation of somatic
markers sufﬁces to bias a decision, such that the somatic markers are not actually
generated. Of the three stages of this model (preconscious appraisal, elicitation of
somatic states, perception of these states influences a decision), the ﬁrst one is more
or less established. Preconscious appraisal mechanisms are an integral aspect of a
wide range of appraisal theories of emotions (Lazarus 1982, 1984; Scherer et al.
2001); these however usually assume that the preconscious appraisal directly
influences decisions or actions. Also, the second stage—elicitation of somatic states
—is an established ﬁnding: emotions have physiological correlates (Coan and Allen
2007), and some have proposed that the subjective experience of emotions is based
on the perception of these body states (James 1884; Reisenzein 1983; Schachter and
Singer 1962). The interesting aspect of the SMH was that the perception of body
states guides value-based decisions, and that this is required for optimal
decision-making.
    This proposal was tested in a series of studies using the Iowa Gambling task
(IGT) in which participants repeatedly bet on one of four lotteries (realised as card
decks) and learn, via feedback, the statistics of each card deck, see, e.g. (Bechara
et al. 1996, 1997). Two card decks have a negative expected value, the other two a
positive expected value. As soon as participants can gauge the expected loss and
gain, it would be optimal to mostly bet on the decks with positive outcome,
although some exploration might still be necessary in order to learn more about the
negative decks (Dunn et al. 2006). In studies in which SCR were recorded (Bechara
et al. 1996, 1997), anticipatory SCR during decision and outcome anticipation were
higher on trials on which a deck with negative expected outcome was chosen,
compared to a positive deck. During the course of learning, these increased SCR
were observed when participants started preferring to bet on the positive decks but
before participants verbally reported knowledge of the advantageous strategy
(Bechara et al. 1997). That is, they mostly made advantageous choices and had
increased SCR when making disadvantageous choices, but when asked what they
knew about the task, they did not state different value of the decks, or a coherent
strategy. Patients with ventromedial prefrontal lesions lesions who do not learn to
pick the card decks with positive expected outcome did not show this SCR signal
(Bechara et al. 1996, 1997).
    The SMH has received much attention and also criticism (Dunn et al. 2006).
Here I will only discuss whether SCR constitute a somatic marker that is used for
decision-making. Two hypotheses appear relevant: (a) Advantageous decisions in
18   Skin Conductance Measures in Neuroeconomic Research                             353

the IGT are taken before explicit knowledge is reported; hence there must be
preconscious decision biases. (b) These preconscious biases are conveyed by
somatic states; i.e. somatic states have a causal influence on decisions.
   The ﬁrst point is somewhat unclear in the original studies because people were
not explicitly questioned about the statistics of the four card decks, in order to assess
their conscious knowledge. They were only asked to report anything they had
gathered about the task (Bechara et al. 1997). In further experiments with more
explicit questions, people were actually aware of the statistics in the IGT at the
moment when they started making advantageous decisions (Bowman et al. 2005;
Maia and McClelland 2004). This may mean that preconscious signals are not
required to make optimal decisions in this task. The SMH authors have addressed
these ﬁndings by arguing that somatic markers would even guide decision-making
when there was conscious knowledge (Bechara et al. 2005). To substantiate this
assertion, one could investigate whether somatic markers are more closely related to
decisions than explicit knowledge. Indeed, explicit knowledge and elevated SCR
during choice of bad decks in the IGT have been reported (Guillaume et al. 2009).
However, it is not known whether SCR explain variance in the decisions that is
unexplained by declarative knowledge. In summary, as yet there is no clear evidence
that preconscious biases—conveyed via somatic states or otherwise—are used to
guide behaviour in the IGT, over and above an influence of declarative knowledge.
   The second question is whether potential preconscious influences are conveyed
via somatic states during deliberation (the ‘body loop’) (Damasio 1994). Of course
it would be highly inefﬁcient if the brain computed values preconsciously, sent a
message to the body, and used sensors to pick up those body states to come to a
deliberate decision; the brain could wire this signal directly to the decision-making
system (Rolls 1999). Indeed, according to the SMH, preconscious signal may also
be conveyed by anticipation of somatic states (the ‘as-if’-loop) (Damasio 1994).
For the body loop, somatic states would have to be generated before a decision is
being made. It turns out that the IGT studies are not ideally suited to determine
whether SCR were generated before or after decisions. The reason is that partici-
pants were instructed to ponder their decisions for at least 15 s and were then
instructed by the experimenter to rapidly indicate their selection (Bechara et al.
1996, 1997) such that it is not known when participants made a decision in their
mind. Hence, SCR could have been elicited before or after a decision. For example,
in a simple Go/NoGo task, incorrect choice are followed by larger SCRs before
feedback is given (Whitney et al. 2007). This appears to reflect post-decision error
monitoring and is not a pre-decision response.
   One conclusion that might be drawn from the original IGT study is that the
anticipation of negative monetary outcomes is reflected in larger SCR. However,
there is a twist to the IGT: in the original version, the two lotteries with negative
mean outcomes are associated with a larger outcome variance than the two lotteries
with positive expected outcome. In another replication study, this confound was
reversed: here, the two positive lotteries were associated with the larger outcome
variance. In this study, larger SCR were observed in responses to choosing the
positive lotteries (Tomb et al. 2002). Taking this and the initial study together, this
354                                                                           D.R. Bach

suggests that sympathetic arousal might be associated with variance of the pre-
dictive distribution rather than with its mean—variance is a measure of the pre-
dictive uncertainty (see Chap. 6 in this book). However, a study that independently
varied mean and variance of outcome distributions has reported somewhat incon-
clusive results on this question (Yen et al. 2012).



18.6    Current Use of SCR in Neuroeconomic Research,
        and Framework for Future Studies

Phasic SCR are currently used in a plethora of neuroeconomic investigations; very
few studies report tonic SF. There is still research on the implications of the somatic
marker hypothesis (Botvinick and Rosen 2009; Crone and van der Molen 2007;
Hinson et al. 2006; Miu et al. 2008; Visagan et al. 2012; Wagar and Dixon 2006).
Many studies examine affective influences on decision-making, for example
influences of empathy (Hein et al. 2011), negative emotional arousal (Sarlo et al.
2012; Sokol-Hessner et al. 2009; Van’t Wout et al. 2006), anxiety (Engelmann et al.
2015), and stress (Heereman and Walla 2011). Other researchers were interested in
the opposite relation: the effect of decision outcomes on affective state (Bediou et al.
2011). Some investigators have used SCR to index the success of aversive learning
(Delgado et al. 2011), to assess the integration of positive and negative outcomes
(Talmi et al. 2009), or to measure cognitive effort (Salvia et al. 2012).
    Other research has elucidated economic variables that impact on SCR. SCR
amplitude covaries with expected outcome (Studer and Clark 2011; Studer et al.
2016; Wu et al. 2016), with outcome undertainty in various forms of gambles (de
Berker et al. 2016; Tomb et al. 2002), and with counterfactual reasoning after
decision outcomes (Wu et al. 2016).
    The richness of these different approaches reflects the relatively unspeciﬁc nature
of phasic sympathetic arousal and points to a methodological difﬁculty: sympathetic
arousal measures can only be interpreted if there is experimental control over its
antecedents, and competing antecedents can be kept constant. For example, if
phasic sympathetic arousal is taken to index emotional processes, then cognitive
effort, vigour of motor responses, and other sources of sympathetic arousal need to
be controlled. Importantly, economic decisions can involve different levels of
cognitive effort as a possible confound—depending, for example on the number of
choice possibilities, or the difﬁculty of computations to determine statistics of
outcome distributions.
    An interesting issue is the speciﬁcity of body states. One corollary of the SMH is
that bodily states can convey highly speciﬁc economic signals. No such speciﬁcity has
yet been found. However, this idea relates to the early proposal of emotion speciﬁcity
in bodily signals, discussed at least since James (1884). The combination of con-
temporary multivariate techniques has brought some fresh air into this research ﬁeld
(Stephens et al. 2010). In order to better identify pattern of bodily states in economic

decision-making paradigms, it would be useful to acquire other indicators of auto-
nomic arousal together with SCR. Recently, model-based analysis methods have been
developed for event-related changes in heart period (Castegnetti et al. 2016; Paulus
et al. 2016), respiration (Bach et al., 2016), and in pupil size (Korn and Bach 2016).
These approaches are simple to implement, and this may facilitate the use of such
measures in neuroeconomic research
    To summarise, it is desirable to experimentally constrain possible sources of
sympathetic arousal such as cognitive effort and motor responses, in neuroeconomic
research. As measure of sympathetic arousal, SCR may be complemented by other
peripheral measures of autonomic nervous activity such as heart period or pupil
size. This could also lead to a better understanding of the pattern of bodily states
induced by economic variables. Nevertheless, SCR, and the underlying sympathetic
arousal, can be a very useful measure in decision-making experiments, and it is not
surprising that it is currently as popular as ever.
