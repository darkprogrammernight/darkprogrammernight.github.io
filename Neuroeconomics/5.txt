Monoamines and Decision-Making
Under Risks

Abstract Past neuroeconomics studies using neurophysiology methods (mainly
fMRI) have revealed the neural basis of “boundedly rational” or “irrational”
decision-making that violates normative economics theory. It is expected that the
ﬁeld of neuroeconomics will be merged with neurotransmitter research and clinical
neuroscience. Here, we provide an overview of recent molecular neuroimaging
studies to understand how central monoamine transmission is related to “irrational”
decision-making. Empirical evidence suggests that central dopamine transmission
might be related to distortion of subjective reward probability and noradrenaline
and serotonin transmission might influence aversive emotional reaction to ﬁnancial
loss. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a powerful tool to understand the
neurochemical basis of decision-making in vivo in human. This approach seems to
be a promising direction to understand the neurobiology of impaired decision-
making in neuropsychiatric disorders and may help to develop novel pharma-
cotherapy for them.



5.1    Introduction

In normative economics theory, decision-makers are assumed to be “rational” and
purely self-interested. However, we are not always rational, and sometimes show
“boundedly rational” or “irrational” decision-making. Laboratory and ﬁeld evi-
dence from behavioral economics has shown that decision-makers systematically
depart from normative theory (Camerer and Loewenstein 2004; Camerer and Fehr
2006; Takahashi et al. 2012b). Because behavioral economics deals with the effects
of cognitive and emotional factors on economic decisions, not surprisingly, it has
been merged with neuroscientiﬁc studies about cognition and emotions, and this
interdisciplinary approach is called neuroeconomics.

    Over the last decade, neuroeconomics utilizing neurophysiology methods (fMRI
or EEG) has been advanced, revealing the neural basis of “boundedly rational” or
“irrational” decision-making that violates normative theory. Past neuroeconomics
studies have demonstrated that, in addition to cortical regions such as the prefrontal
cortex (PFC), subcortical emotion-related brain areas are involved in “irrational”
decision-making (Sanfey et al. 2003; Singer et al. 2006; Takahashi et al. 2009;
Yamada et al. 2012). The next question is how neurotransmission modulate these
central processes (Trepel et al. 2005; Rangel et al. 2008). In this chapter, we provide
an overview of recent research to understand the neurochemical basis of “irrational”
decision-making under risks.



5.2    Nonlinear Probability Weighting

One type of systematic departure from normative economic theory is that subjective
weights on probabilities appear to be nonlinear. Decision-makers often overestimate
low probabilities (e.g., playing lotteries) and underestimate high probabilities.
A leading alternative to normative theory (expected utility theory) is the prospect
theory (Tversky and Kahneman 1992). One of the important components of the
prospect theory is nonlinear probability weighting, where objective probabilities, p,
are transformed nonlinearly into decision weights w(p) by a weighting function
(Fig. 5.1).
    Experimental studies suggest that the weighting function is regressive, asym-
metric, and inverse S-shaped, crossing the diagonal from above at an inflection
point (around 1/3) where p = w(p). Although several functions have been proposed
to express nonlinear probability weighting, the one-parameter function derived
axiomatically by Prelec (1998), w(p) = exp{−(ln(1/p))α} with 0 < α < 1, is widely
used. In an inverse S-shaped nonlinear weighting function, low probabilities are
overweighted and moderate to high probabilities are underweighted. The function
neatly explains the typically observed pattern of risk-seeking for low probability
gain and risk-aversion toward high-probability gain.
    Paulus and Frank (2006) investigated the neural substrates that are related to
nonlinear probability transformation using fMRI with a certainty equivalent pro-
cedure. During this procedure, a gamble’s certainty equivalent, the amount of sure
payoff at which a player is indifferent between the sure payoff and the gamble, was
determined. The authors found that differential anterior cingulate activation during
estimation of high probabilities relative to low probabilities was positively corre-
lated with Prelec’s nonlinearity parameter α across subjects. Another fMRI study
with risks of negative outcomes (electric shocks) found similar nonlinear response
in brain regions including the caudate/subgenual anterior cingulate (Berns et al.
2008). However, it was reported that the dorsolateral PFC was involved in over-
weighting low probabilities and underweighting high probabilities, and that the
ventral frontal regions showed the opposite pattern (Tobler et al. 2008). More
recently, Hsu et al. (2009) reported that the degree of nonlinearity in the neural

Fig. 5.1 Hypothesized model showing the contribution of central DA transmission to nonlinear
probability weighting. A smaller value of α (closer to 0) means a more nonlinear inflected
weighting function and a higher value (closer to 1) means a more linear weighting function. At
α = 1 the function is linear (dashed line). DA transmission might play a central role in distorting
probability weighting function nonlinearly. Excessive DA transmission might cause exaggerated
overestimation of low probability and underestimation of moderate to high probabilities (black
arrow)


response to anticipated reward in the striatum reflected the nonlinearity parameter
as estimated behaviorally. The discrepancies regarding the loci of activation are
thought to stem from differences in the task (probability range, context, etc.) and
analysis of parameter estimation. However, it seems to be promising to investigate
the role of the dopamine (DA) system in nonlinear probability weighting, because
DA is linked to risk-seeking behavior (Leyton et al. 2002) and excessive DA release
was observed in pathological gambling in Parkinson’s disease patients (Steeves
et al. 2009). Trepel et al. (2005) hypothesized in an insightful review that DA
transmission in the striatum might be involved in shaping probability weighting.
Taking advantage of in vivo molecular neuroimaging [positron emission tomog-
raphy (PET)], we investigated the relationship between central DA transmission
and nonlinear probability weighting.
   Certainty equivalents were determined outside the PET scanner, and we esti-
mated probability weighting using the Prelec’s one-parameter function. There was
positive correlation between striatal D1 receptor binding measured by [11C]
SCH23390 PET and the nonlinearity parameter α of weighting function (Fig. 5.2)
(Takahashi et al. 2010a). No correlation was found between D2 receptor binding
measured by [11C]raclopride PET and nonlinearity parameter α. That is, subjects
with lower striatal D1 receptor binding tend to show more pronounced
88                                                                               H. Takahashi

overestimation of low probabilities and underestimation of high probabilities. [11C]
SCH23390 is a selective radioligand for D1 receptors, but it also has some afﬁnity
for serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptors. 5HT2A receptor density in the striatum is
negligible compared to D1 receptor density. However, 5HT2A receptor density is
never negligible in extrastriatal regions (Ekelund et al. 2007). Future studies with a
more selective radioligand are recommended to test the role of extrastriatal (cor-
tical) D1 receptors in nonlinear weighting.
    Mis-estimation of probabilities, especially of low probabilities, might be related
to some problematic behaviors in neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinical studies have
reported the emergence of pathological gambling in Parkinson’s disease patients
taking DA agonist medication (Gallagher et al. 2007; Dagher and Robbins 2009),
and such patients showed increased DA release in the ventral striatum measured by
[11C]raclopride PET during gambling (Steeves et al. 2009). Although pathological
gambling is a heterogeneous disorder and cannot be solely attributed to misesti-
mating probability, these clinical observations can lead to the hypothesis that
excessive DA transmission might cause distortion of subjective probability weights
for gains (positive outcomes) (Fig. 5.1) (Takahashi 2012, 2013). However, non-
linear probability weighting is a combination of risk-seeking (overestimation of low
probability) and risk-aversion (underestimation of high probability). In fact, a recent
study reported that pathological gamblers demonstrated an overall shift towards
risk, rather than excessive distortion of nonlinear probability weighting in
decision-making under risks (Ligneul et al. 2012). From a psychological point of
view, the overweighting of low probability gains may reflect the hope of winning,
and it is reasonable to link DA tone and an overall shift towards risk.

Underweighting of high-probability gains may reflect the fear of losing a “near sure
thing”. Thus, the shape of weighting function, especially in the high-probability
portion, should be determined by multiple neurotransmitters other than DA
(Takahashi et al. 2010b), such as 5-HT (Takahashi et al. 2005) and norepinephrine
(NE) (Onur et al. 2009), which are also known to modulate the emotional reaction
of fear. Furthermore, the role of neurotransmitters in nonlinear probability
weighting for losses (negative outcomes) should be tested as well.



5.3   Loss Aversion

Pain derived from losing a certain amount of money appears to be greater than the
pleasure derived from gaining the equivalent amount. Imagine having a chance to
participate in a coin-flip game of chance. Using a fair coin, if the outcome is heads,
you will win $100, and if the outcome is tails, you will lose $100. Are you willing
to participate in this gamble? Typically, most people would say “no”. Well, how
about the following gamble? If the winning prize is increased to $200, while the
potential loss remains $100. In this case, some people would say “yes”. This means
that, typically, losses have at least twice the impact of equivalent gains, a tendency
called loss aversion (Tversky and Kahneman 1992). Loss aversion is a robust
phenomenon, and many laboratory and ﬁeld studies have found evidence in
monkeys for food rewards, and in humans for ﬁnancial outcomes, features of
consumer goods, food rewards, game show winnings, and apartment sales (Camerer
and Loewenstein 2004; Chen et al. 2006; Knutson et al. 2007). In prospect theory,
this is expressed by a value function of losses that is steeper than that of gains
(Fig. 5.3).
   An fMRI study has shown that the PFC and striatum are involved in loss
aversion (Tom et al. 2007). On the other hand, brain lesion studies have reported
that amygdala lesion patients showed diminished loss aversion (De Martino et al.
2010). Sokol-Hessner et al. (2009) have shown that physiological arousal response
(skin conductance response) to losses was greater than to equivalent gains on
average. This ﬁnding indicates that losses are more emotionally laden and salient
than equivalent gains. The study also reported that individuals with greater arousal
response to losses versus gains tend to be more loss-aversive. More recently, the
same research team, using fMRI, reported a correlation between behavioral loss
aversion and amygdala activation in response to losses relative to gains (Sokol-
Hessner et al. 2012).
   It is known that 5-HT plays an important role in modulating emotional response
or affective state, and enhancing central 5-HT transmission by selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) decreases amygdala activation in response to aversive
stimuli (Takahashi et al. 2005). Although there are no PET studies investigating the
relationship between 5-HT transmission and loss aversion directly, empirical evi-
dence suggest that central 5-HT tone might be associated with loss aversion.
Enhancing 5-HT transmission by tryptophan load reduced the “reflection effect”

Fig. 5.3 Hypothesized model showing the contribution of central 5HT and NE transmission to
loss aversion. 5-HT and NE might contribute to shaping the slope of value function for loss. 5-HT
might ease the slope of value function for loss (loss tolerance: gray), and NE might intensify the
slope (loss aversion: black). The value function is usually assumed to be a power function v
(x) = xσ, but we used common simplifying assumptions that σ is 1 for both value functions in gain
and loss domains. The ratio (loss/gain) of the slope of linear functions was indicated as λ


(Murphy et al. 2009). “Reflection effect” refers to the fact that decision-makers tend
to prefer the sure $50 gain to a 50/50 gamble to win $100 or no gain at all, showing
risk-aversion. However, decision-makers tend to prefer a 50/50 gamble to lose $100
or no loss at all to the sure $50 loss, showing risk-seeking. Loss aversion can partly
account for “reflection effect” and “framing effect”. De Martino et al. (2006)
reported that susceptibility to the framing effect was associated with amygdala
activation. Then they reported that genetic variation in the promoter region of the
5-HT transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) predicted the susceptibility to the framing
effect. Homozygosity for the minor s-allele showed greater amygdala activation
during decision-making and stronger framing effect than l-allele carriers (Roiser
et al. 2009). More recently, large-sample behavioral economics studies in an Asian
sample also showed that homozygosity for the s-allele showed higher loss aversion
than l-allele carriers (He et al. 2010). It is difﬁcult to estimate pre-and post-synaptic
(and net) 5-HT transmission exactly by genetic variation in 5-HTTLPR (Shioe et al.
2003), but 5-HT neurotransmission seems to attenuate the aversion to ﬁnancial loss
(Fig. 5.3) (Takahashi 2012, 2013).
   In addition to 5-HT, a line of evidence suggests that norepinephrine (NE) might
be involved in loss aversion. The role of NE in arousal is well established (Berridge
and Waterhouse 2003), and it was reported that physiological arousal response was

associated with behavioral loss aversion (Sokol-Hessner et al. 2009). Blocking
central NE transmission by propranolol attenuated the sensitivity to the magnitude
of possible losses at gambles (Rogers et al. 2004). Lack of appropriate PET radi-
oligand has prevented us from investigating the role of central NE transmission in
cognition, emotion, and decision-making in vivo. However, (S,S)-18F-FMeNER-
D2 has recently been developed as a radioligand for the measurement of NE
transporter (NET) for PET (Schou et al. 2004; Arakawa et al. 2008). (S,S)-
18F-FMeNER-D2 is a reboxetine analog and has high afﬁnity and high selectivity
for NET. We utilized PET scans with (S,S)-[18F]FMeNER-D2 to investigate the
relationship between NET in the brain and loss aversion. A NET-rich region
available to PET imaging with this ligand is the thalamus. The amygdala and PFC
are also innervated by NE, but the relatively low expression of NET prevented
reliable measurement of their NET binding.
    Loss aversion parameters were determined outside the PET scanner using a
50:50 mixed gamble (gain–loss). This parameter λ is similar to the parameter in
prospect theory but makes the common simplifying assumptions of a linear rather
than curvilinear value function (Fig. 5.3), and identical decision weights for a 0.5
probability of a gain or loss. The ﬁnding was that there was a negative correlation
between λ and NET binding in the thalamus (Fig. 5.4) (Takahashi et al. 2013). In
other words, individuals with low thalamic NET are likely to show pronounced loss
aversion. Although NE has been implicated in arousal, previous studies also sug-
gest that NE affects processing of salient information (Berridge and Waterhouse
2003). Neurons of the locus coeruleus (LC), the major source of NE in the brain, are
physically evoked by salient or emotional stimuli (Aston-Jones et al. 1994), and
phasic LC activation also increases NE release in target sites (Berridge and

summed PET image of (S,S)-[18F]FMeNER-D2. Right panel shows negative correlation between
NET binding in the thalamus and loss aversion parameter λ
92                                                                       H. Takahashi

Waterhouse 2003). Enhancing NE tone by NE reuptake inhibitor improves detec-
tion of emotional stimuli (De Martino et al. 2008), and blocking central NE
transmission by propranolol predominantly impairs processing of negatively
emotional stimuli (Cahill et al. 1994). Thus, PET ﬁndings suggest that individuals
with low NET in the thalamus might show enhanced effect of NE released by
salient stimuli due to low reuptake, and consequently show exaggerated emotional
or arousal response to losses relative to gains. Thalamic NET might be an indirect
mediator of the relationship between NE transmission and loss aversion. Similarly
to 5-HT systems, Rasch et al. (2009) reported that a genetic variation of ADRA2B,
the gene encoding the α2b-adrenergic receptor, predicted the amygdala responsivity
to negative stimuli. Future studies with a more appropriate radioligand for mea-
suring NET in the amygdala and PFC, which are implicated in loss aversion, are
recommended. For the present, it is not unreasonable to suppose that central NE
tone plays a role in shaping the slope of the value function in the loss domain
(Fig. 5.3) (Takahashi 2012, 2013).
   In a clinical setting, NET blocker, atomoxetine, is widely used in the pharma-
cotherapy of Attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). ADHD patients are
known to show impulsive and reckless decision-making and have high comorbidity
rates of drug addiction and gamble addiction (pathological gambling) (Pattij and
Vanderschuren 2008; Breyer et al. 2009). Our ﬁnding suggests that atomoxetine
might shift ADHD patients’ decision-making from reckless (less loss-aversive) to
more cautious (more loss-aversive) by blocking NET. Although pathological
gambling is a heterogeneous disorder with various social and biological back-
grounds, one can make a prediction that NET inhibitors might be beneﬁcial for a
subgroup of pathological gambling who show diminished aversive responses to
ﬁnancial losses (Takahashi 2013). Compared to the DA system, the role of the NE
system in reward processing has been less studied, and speciﬁcally, the research
ﬁeld that would elucidate the role of NE in decision-making in normal and
pathological populations is worthy of further development.



5.4   Conclusion

The PET technique is a powerful tool to understand the neurochemical basis of
decision-making in vivo in human (Takahashi et al. 2012a). However, pharmaco-
logical studies as well as animal studies are necessary for a better understanding of
the detailed mechanism. It is expected that the ﬁeld of neuroeconomics will be
merged with pharmacological/neurotransmitter research and clinical neuroscience
(Rangel et al. 2008). This approach seems a promising direction to understand the
neurobiology of impaired decision-making in neuropsychiatric disorders and
develop novel pharmacotherapy for them (Takahashi 2012; Takahashi et al. 2012b;
Takahashi 2013).
