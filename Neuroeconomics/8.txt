How the Experience of Time Shapes
Decision-Making

Abstract We present an outline of a model for how the subjective experience of
time influences decision-making. First, an individual’s time perspective determines
how strongly attention is directed to time. A stronger emphasis on the present
perspective at the expense of the future perspective—as seen in impulsive indi-
viduals—leads to a stronger focus on the passage of time in waiting situations. This
in turn causes longer estimates of duration. In intertemporal decisions, a relative
overestimation of duration can lead to the perception of delayed rewards lying too
far in the future. As a consequence, the value of a future commodity is discounted
and more immediate but less valuable rewards are preferred. We present empirical
evidence on the relationship between time perception and intertemporal
decision-making and discuss these ﬁndings within the respective psychological and
neural models.



8.1    Introduction

Time plays a pivotal role in decision-making. Several temporal aspects can be
identiﬁed which are relevant for different processing stages in decision-making
(Ariely and Zakay 2001; Klapproth 2008). For example, time can be a scarce or
abundant resource when making decisions: how much time do I have before I must
choose an option? Time is a commodity and subject matter of decisions: how many

days of vacation do I take? In both examples, subjective estimates of duration
influence our decisions. Duration and the passage of time are either experienced at
present (“at the moment I have plenty of time”) or they are anticipated as future
intervals (“tomorrow I won’t have enough time”). Moreover, future intervals are
anticipated in relation to the momentary experience of time, i.e., as waiting time
until the occurrence of an event or as waiting time until the end of an ongoing
event.
    In a classiﬁcation of subjective time at least three interrelated dimensions can be
discerned, which are important for decision-making (Wittmann 2009a): (1) the time
perspectives of past, present, and future; (2) an individual’s time estimation abilities
as measured by the accuracy in estimating clock time; (3) time awareness as the
subjective impression of time passing relatively fast or slow. Typically, we flexibly
switch between time perspectives, either focusing on the past to evaluate present
options or imaging the future to create alternative goal states. Decisions thus are
based on the tripartite structure of temporal experience with past, present, and future
(Zimbardo and Boyd 1999). Choices are also related to the explicit estimation of
duration and the awareness of the passage of time experienced just now and as
anticipated for future time intervals. Do we stand in line at the post ofﬁce or do we
move on to run some other errands? At what point in time do we complain when the
waiter does not bring the ordered meal? When purchasing goods on the Internet do
we pay an extra sum in order to receive the product earlier?
    In this chapter, we show how the three interrelated dimensions of subjective time
are subject to modiﬁcations and how this influences our decisions. In short, we
propose that a more pronounced present perspective at the expense of the future
perspective leads to a stronger focus on the momentary passage of time, which
results in longer duration estimates. A relative overestimation of duration, the
feeling of having to wait too long, consequently leads to choices with short-term
outcomes over those with long-term consequences (Wittmann and Paulus 2008,
2009). Such shortsightedness in decision-making can lead to negative consequences
in the long run, subjective time strongly affecting life achievements (Mischel et al.
1989). Thereafter, the ability to delay gratiﬁcation is to a certain extent dependent
upon the temporal perspective as well as the consequent experience of duration.
    In this chapter, we will discuss models of time perception and show how
experienced time is subject to alterations. Investigations with impulsive individuals
have led the way for understanding the relation between time perception and
decision-making. As a paradigmatic example of how modiﬁcations of time occur
and how these modiﬁcations influence decision-making, we will speciﬁcally
highlight research on addiction. Individuals who are substance dependent show a
profound change in subjective time, which is associated with maladaptive
decision-making. The empirical ﬁndings on additive behavior will be related to
models of time perception. Finally, we will summarize results from neuroimaging
studies showing how similar brain systems are involved in the estimation of
duration and the anticipation of future intervals in intertemporal decision-making.

8.2    Modiﬁcations in the Experience of Time

An individual’s time perspective dynamically changes according to transient situ-
ational demands. Present choices are made for future outcomes, reasoning that
depends upon past experiences. However, a dominance regarding one of the tem-
poral perspectives can manifest itself as a consequence of life events. Sudden
critical life events, i.e., unexpected unemployment or a life-threatening illness (van
Laarhoven et al. 2011) can dramatically shorten the future perspective of a person
and lead to the dominance of the present perspective as only short-term plans
become relevant (Carstensen 2006). In addition, the relative dominance of the
present perspective at the expense of the future perspective can be seen as a per-
sonality trait in impulsive individuals (Zimbardo and Boyd 1999). Impulsive
behavior is deﬁned as reacting to the immediate situation without thinking about
future consequences. That is, impulsivity is conceptualized as extreme temporal
shortsightedness.1 For example, a stronger focus on the present at the expense of the
future is strongly related to impulsive behavior such as gambling, having unpro-
tected sex, risky driving, or using drugs (Zimbardo et al. 1997; Keough et al. 1999).
    In cognitive models of time estimation and, related, of time awareness,
prospective and retrospective time is distinguished (Zakay and Block 1997, 2004).
Prospective time estimation is concerned with the perception of duration or the
passage of time as presently experienced. An observer directs more or less attention
to the passage of time while a particular duration is judged. If more attention is
directed to time during an explicit duration estimation task, a temporal interval is
experienced as lasting comparatively longer than when attention is distracted from
time (Conti 2001). In retrospective time, when we judge the passage of time of an
interval that already has passed, duration is reconstructed from memory. The more
contextual changes and events experienced during that time span (which are stored
in memory and later retrieved), the longer that interval appears to have lasted in
retrospect (Flaherty et al. 2005; Bailey and Areni 2006). Similarly, the more event
markers deﬁning the duration between the present moment and the past event are
remembered, the longer retrospective time (Zauberman et al. 2010). Whereas
prospective time perception only applies to intervals up to a few minutes—an
assumed prospective timing mechanism has an upper limit of temporal integration—
retrospective time estimation can refer to memory contents of an individual’s life time
(Wittmann and Lehnhoff 2005).
    In prospective time two factors lead to modiﬁcations in the estimation of
duration as explained within the framework of pacemaker-accumulator models

 In this context one has to differentiate between an impulsive present orientation and
present-mindedness as trained through meditation techniques. The former is associated with a
strong urge to act in the present moment, whereas the latter is associated with an observational
state associated with more self-control. This is important because meditation is now being con-
sidered as a way of treating drug-addicted individuals. The value for meditation is that it can
disconnect experience from impulsive action leading to more self-controlled behavior.

(Gibbon et al. 1984; Treisman 1963; Zakay and Block 1997). In these models a
pacemaker produces a regular series of pulses that are fed into an accumulator. The
number of pulses that has been recorded for a given time span represents experi-
enced duration. However, pulses are only accumulated when attention is actually
directed to time. Therefore, and since the number of collected pulses represents
duration, more attention to time leads to longer duration estimates. Additionally, an
increased arousal level is related to a higher pacemaker rate which in turn leads to
greater accumulation of pulses during a given time period—thus causing longer
estimates of duration (Burle and Casini 2001; Droit-Volet and Meck 2007;
Wittmann and Paulus 2008).
    Modiﬁcations of subjective duration caused by emotional states are interpreted
within the framework of the pacemaker-accumulator models (Droit-Volet 2009;
Noulhiane et al. 2007; Wittmann 2009b). First, and related to attention, patients in
psychological distress such as those with depression (Bschor et al. 2004) or cancer
patients with high levels of anxiety (Wittmann et al. 2006) perceive a slowing of the
pace of time and overestimate duration. The presence of emotional distress in these
individuals diverts attentional resources away from ongoing thoughts and actions to
the passage of time (Twenge et al. 2003). Second, and related to transient arousal
states in healthy subjects, stimuli with emotional content are typically judged to last
longer than more neutral stimuli (Droit-Volet and Gil 2009). These ﬁndings are
explained by heightened arousal levels of subjects judging the duration of stimuli
with emotional content. For example, participants who watched footage of the 9/11
events perceived the duration of the ﬁlm to last longer than a more neutral ﬁlm with
the same duration (Anderson et al. 2007). In another study, young healthy male
college students ﬁrst had to rate photographs of sexually attractive female lingerie
models. In a following session, subjects anticipated future intervals to last longer
than subjects who had previously rated less exiting photographs (Kim and
Zauberman 2012).
    Studies with impulsive individuals provide the empirical basis for conceptual
explanations of how subjective time influences decision-making. Experimentally,
analyzing performance in intertemporal decision tasks can reveal the temporal
shortsightedness in impulsive individuals. Participants have to choose between
smaller rewards that can be consumed earlier and rewards that can be obtained only
later. Most of people have the tendency to discount future rewards, the subjective
value of future rewards decreases considerably with increasing waiting time
(Ainslie 1975; Prelec and Loewenstein 1997). Given the choice, individuals are
more likely to prefer an immediate reward over a later reward (even when it has
greater value). This tendency becomes stronger when waiting times for the delayed
reward increase. The discounting function is steeper at shorter delays (the rate of
discounting is higher) and becomes flatter as the delay of the reward increases (the
rate of discounting is lower). This speciﬁc hyperbolic discounting pattern is dis-
cussed as stemming from the fact that people’s estimates of duration do not cor-
respond to objective time in a linear way, but that objective time is perceived
logarithmically (Takahashi 2005; Wackermann 2007; Zauberman et al. 2008).
Thereafter, hyperbolic discounting of delayed rewards is dependent upon the
8 How the Experience of Time Shapes Decision-Making                                137

psychophysical characteristics of subjective time. The diminishing sensitivity to
longer time intervals, as delays are perceived logarithmically, thus contributes to the
degree of hyperbolic discounting (Kim and Zauberman 2009).
    The propensity to even more strongly discount delayed rewards (an even
stronger preference for immediate consumption) is one of the key ﬁndings in
studies with impulsive individuals (Kirby et al. 1999; Barkley et al. 2001). Behavior
of impulsive individuals in delay discounting tasks has been related to alterations in
subjective time (Wittmann and Paulus 2008, 2009): Impulsive individuals more
strongly attend to time due to their increased focus on the present moment at the
expense of the future perspective. Stronger attention to the passage of time leads to
an overestimation of duration. A general overestimation of duration in turn causes
the impression that delayed events lie too far in the future—as a consequence value
of future commodities is discounted and more immediate rewards are preferred. For
example, children and adults with attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (Rubia
et al. 2009) and subjects who are transiently more impulsive through sleep depri-
vation (Reynolds and Schiffbauer 2004) overestimate duration in the multiple
seconds range and they discount more strongly future rewards. That is, a relative
overestimation of duration caused by a stronger present time orientation may
underlie the shortsighted choices in intertemporal decision-making.



8.3    An Excursus: Time Experience in Addiction

Findings in addiction research shed light on core questions of neuroeconomics.
Within the context of conceptualizations related to impulsivity and self-control, an
addicted individual shows strong preference changes which are based on alterations
in the representation of “value” and “decision utility” (Monterosso et al. 2012).
Speciﬁcally, a drug addict’s altered sense of time could be one reason for a stronger
decay of value of temporally delayed rewards. Drug-dependent individuals might
opt more often for smaller and immediate rewards over delayed but higher rewards
because they anticipate the temporal delay to last longer than do people who have
no addiction (Wittmann and Paulus 2008, 2009).
   The conceptualization related to an altered experience of time in individuals with
addiction has at least three component processes related to trait impulsivity: First,
these individuals show a stronger emphasis on the present time perspective (as
opposed to the future perspective). Second, attention is directed more strongly to
the momentary passing of time. Third, allocating attentional resources to the here
and now leads to a subjective slowing of time and an overestimation of future time
intervals. Resulting from this experience of time, drug-dependent individuals will
discount delayed rewards more strongly as these rewards lie subjectively too far in
the future.
   Several studies suggest that chronic drug users exhibit a stronger present time
perspective. First of all, individuals who have a stronger focus on the present time
and less focus on the future perspective are also more likely to use alcohol, tobacco,
138                                                       M. Wittmann and M.P. Paulus

and other drugs (Keough et al. 1999). Moreover, alcohol-dependent persons have a
less extensive future perspective as compared to social drinkers (Smart 1968).
Similarly, drug-dependent patients enrolled in a drug treatment program are less
motivated for the future than control subjects (Lavelle et al. 1991); heroin addicts
are less likely to predict events far into the future as they have shortened time
horizons (Alvos et al. 1993). Evidence suggests that a trait-related focus on the
present time is strongly related to trait impulsivity. For example, heroin addicts,
who score signiﬁcantly lower on a future orientation scale, also show more
impulsive behavior in decision-making. These individuals were more likely to play
from a deck of cards that contained immediate gains but that resulted in large,
delayed punishers and overall net losses (Petry et al. 1998). A similar pattern of
impulsive behavior emerged in a study with substance abusing pathological gam-
blers (Petry 2001). Thus, a shortened future time perspective, that is, a poor per-
ception of events in the future, may explain drug-addicted individuals’ persistent
drug use despite future adverse consequences. A shortened time horizon could
increase the likelihood of opting for behavior associated with an immediate beneﬁt
(the pleasurable state induced by the drug) over behavior that leads to delayed
rewards (long-term health).
    There is some consensus that drug users show an altered temporal horizon of
risks and beneﬁts which is consistent with a steeper delay discounting function, i.e.,
the more a reward is delayed in time the stronger the value of the reward decreases
for drug using individuals as compared to controls (Kirby and Petry 2004; Madden
et al. 1999). This tendency to discount values of delayed rewards more rapidly than
comparison subjects has been identiﬁed in different types of substance users
(Vuchinich and Simpson 1998; Reynolds 2004). Future rewards are more strongly
discounted as a function of the number of illicit drugs used and the age onset of ﬁrst
taking substances (alcohol, nicotine, marijuana) in a sample of college students
(Kollins 2003).
    According to the pacemaker-accumulator models of time perception,
drug-dependent individuals who may experience distress because habitual impul-
sive acts of drug taking cannot be instantiated allocate more attentional resources to
the passage of time and, additionally, are in a state of increased physiological
arousal. Both factors in combination lead to an overestimation of experienced
duration. For example, smokers who felt craving for a cigarette but were asked to
wait through a certain time interval before they were again allowed to smoke
experienced time to pass more slowly (Sayette et al. 2005).
    However, it is noteworthy that there are only few studies concerning the esti-
mation of duration in patients with drug addiction. In one study, a signiﬁcant
relative overestimation of an interval in the multiple-second range in patients with
methamphetamine or cocaine dependence as compared to matched controls was
attributable to increased self-reported impulsivity (Wittmann et al. 2007a).
Moreover, patients with heroin addiction showed stronger under-reproductions
of 12-second intervals as compared to controls, a behavior which varied as a
function of withdrawal duration (Aleksandrov 2005). A more pronounced under-
reproduction of duration, essentially an indication that subjective duration has
8 How the Experience of Time Shapes Decision-Making                              139

elapsed faster, is a typical behavior seen in impulsive individuals (Wittmann et al.
2011). Future research on addiction will have to combine the assessments of
subjective time and of behavioral tests in one study in order to more precisely
understand the relationships between time perspective, duration estimation, and
intertemporal decision-making.



8.4   The Neural Correlates of Subjective Time

Individual state- and trait-related modulations of the time perspectives are associ-
ated with subjective estimates of duration, which in turn affects temporal
decision-making. The dynamical relation within the dimensions of subjective time
determines time-related preferences and behavioral choices. If intertemporal deci-
sions are so strongly dependent upon the perception and anticipation of duration,
then research in the neurosciences should reveal activation of similar underlying
brain structures for time perception and for intertemporal decision-making.
However, the neural basis underlying subjective time and temporal preferences in
decision-making remains controversial. That is, a large number of brain areas and
systems have been identiﬁed as underlying the experience of duration as well as
governing behavior in intertemporal decision-making. For reviews of functional
neuroimaging studies on the perception of duration, see Lewis and Miall (2003);
Wiener et al. (2010); for neuroimaging reviews on intertemporal decision-making,
see Monterosso and Luo (2010) and Carter et al. (2010).
    Here we want to focus on two brain areas, which have repeatedly been shown to
be coactivated in functional neuroimaging studies, and which might speciﬁcally be
related to the processing of time: the striatum and the insular cortex. Functional
neuroimaging studies of time perception show how the striatum and the insular
cortex are activated during the perception of shorter duration in the
millisecond-to-a-few-seconds range (e.g., Livesey et al. 2007; for a review of
studies see Wittmann 2009b) as well as during the perception of multiple-second
intervals (Wittmann et al. 2011). Also related to intertemporal decisions, both the
striatum and the insula are often activated as related to different component pro-
cesses (McClure et al. 2007; Wittmann et al. 2007b). Tanaka et al. (2004) provided
the most compelling evidence that the insular cortex and the striatum code for the
selection of immediate and delayed rewards. Ventroanterior regions of these two
brain areas were more activated for immediate choices, dorsoposterior regions were
more activated when subjects learned to choose delayed rewards. In another study
with choices between immediate and delayed rewards in the multiple-second range,
the anterior insula and the striatum were both activated when subjects chose either
the immediate (smaller) or the delayed (larger) option (Wittmann et al. 2010a).
    The insular cortex and the striatum are strongly related to expectation and
anticipation. That is, these two areas are part of brain systems whose functioning is
inherently related to time. The striatum is not only involved in reward evaluations
guiding goal-directed behavior as it tracks perceived value (Gregorios-Pippas et al.
140                                                       M. Wittmann and M.P. Paulus

2009; Kable and Glimscher 2007); it is strongly involved in reward expectation
(Hassani et al. 2001). Similarly, the insular cortex plays a fundamental role in the
neural decision-making system, integrating visceral sensations and emotional states
to modulate decisions (Craig 2002). That is, the insula integrates interoceptive
information as a basis for judging prospective reward value. More speciﬁcally, the
anterior insula, together with the striatum, has been associated with the anticipation
of rewards and the expectation and evaluation of upcoming events (Lovero et al.
2009). In this line, the anterior insula has been discussed as generating a predictive
model, which provides an individual with a signal of how he or she will feel (Paulus
and Stein 2006).
   The close connection between the insular cortex and the integration of ascending
body signals on the one hand (Craig 2002) and ﬁndings of modulations of insular
cortex activation and physiological changes of the body affecting time perception
on the other hand (Wittmann et al. 2010; Meissner and Wittmann 2011) have led to
the hypothesis that the accumulation of physiological changes in the body is the
basis for the experience of duration (Craig 2009). Similarly, body states and vis-
ceral factors are strongly involved in decision-making. Drive states such as hunger,
thirst, sexual desire, or the craving for drugs lead to an intense desire that can
dominate the decisions we make (Loewenstein 1996). But emotion- and
body-related signals, changes in visceral states, are to some extent inherently
involved in all of our decisions, not only when self-control is compromised by
overwhelming desires (Damasio 1994; Reimann and Bechara 2010). Complex
decisions related to time and experiences of duration are governed by emotions and
feeling states attributable to processes associated with the striatum and the insula.



8.5   Summary

In order to anticipate upcoming events and to adjust to environmental demands an
individual has to adequately process temporal information. How long do I have to
wait for something to happen or to end? Do I have enough time to prepare for an
exam? Decisions are made between possible outcomes that are perhaps minutes
apart: should I wait for the elevator, do I take the stairs? Human decision-making in
the context of economic planning can encompass the anticipation of outcomes that
lie years or even decades ahead: should I start now to save for retirement? The
human brain constantly generates predictions about present versus future outcomes:
should I now watch TV or go running for long-term physical ﬁtness? The way time
is perceived and how subjective time is modiﬁed is an important factor for
understanding how decisions pertaining to the temporal properties of outcomes are
made.
    Knowledge of how a present bias causes the discounting of delayed beneﬁts can
lead to supportive measures of self-control. Humans intend to be self-controlled but
when faced with concrete options in the here and now they often give into
impulsive acts. For example, due to temporal shortsightedness one might not want
8 How the Experience of Time Shapes Decision-Making                                           141

to deduct a considerable amount of money for a saving option the bank is offering
from now on. However, one might now agree and sign a contract on a plan with
monthly payments that starts in 1 year. If a commitment to act is shifted from the
present to the future more abstract reasoning sets in; when events are temporally
distant, they become psychologically more abstract and people are more inclined to
act according to their more self-controlled reasoning (Trope and Liberman 2003).
   The ultimate test concerning our outline of a model on the relationship between
subjective time and decision-making would be through conducting intervention
studies. Would it be possible to influence maladaptive decision-making through
modiﬁcations of state- and trait-related experiences of time? Intervention programs
could be developed that manipulate the temporal delay of rewards and restructure
the temporal perspective on events and the experience of time in order to promote
desired decision-making.
