Individual Differences in Decision-Making:
A Neural Trait Approach to Study Sources
of Behavioral Heterogeneity

Kyle Nash and Daria Knoch


Abstract People display rich heterogeneity in decision-making, but from where do
these individual differences originate? And what are the processes that underlie
decision-making heterogeneity? In this chapter, we explore a ‘neural trait approach’
in which neuroscience measures of meaningful dispositional differences are used to
illuminate the sources of variability in decision-making. We begin by outlining the
neural trait approach, with a focus on two methods: resting state electroen-
cephalography and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Next, we review inno-
vative studies that have used these methodologies to explore time and social
preferences in decision-making. We then outline future research considerations and
close by discussing certain opportunities and challenges afforded by this research
and the neural trait approach in general.



11.1     Introduction

Behavioral heterogeneity in decision-making is ubiquitous. One person struggles
with temptation and another effortlessly resists the same enticement. One individual
takes a bold risk and another person eschews tempting chance. One person shows
charity and another shows little to no regard for others. Given the same choices in
the same situation, it is relatively assured that people will not act uniformly and will
instead display a rich variety of responses. Economic models of decision-making,
however, primarily describe the ways in which the average person will approach a
given choice (Sanfey 2007; Smith and Huettel 2010; Wischniewski et al. 2009).
Such an approach is uniquely capable of revealing general processes in
decision-making and has been immensely powerful in predicting behavior across
groups (Camerer 2003). Given the manifest heterogeneity of behavior, though,
individual differences have been somewhat underemphasized and represent a ‘ﬁnal

frontier’ that, if explored, can deepen our understanding of decision-making pro-
cesses (Appelt et al. 2011; Braver et al. 2010; Heatherton 2011; Kanai and Rees
2011; Levallois et al. 2012; Wischniewski et al. 2009). Key questions include:
From where do these (often stark) differences in decision-making originate? And
once these sources are discovered, what can be inferred about the psychological
processes that lead to such behavioral heterogeneity?
    Prior work on individual differences in economic decision-making has often
focused on conceptually relevant personality traits. Notable traits include the Big 5
(Becker et al. 2012; Kurzban and Houser 2001; Lu and Argyle 1991), behavioral
inhibition and behavioral activation systems (BIS and BAS, respectively; Carver
and White 1994; Scheres and Sanfey 2006), Machiavellianism (Christie and Geis
1970; Spitzer et al. 2007; Wilson et al. 1998) and social value orientation (Van
Lange 1999, 2000). For example, Scheres and Sanfey (2006) examined whether
BIS (trait aversive motivation) and BAS (trait approach motivation) predicted
behavior in the Dictator game (DG) and the Ultimatum game (UG). They found that
trait levels of approach motivation amongst proposers predicted a strategic shift
from low offers in the DG to higher, even-split offers in the UG (Scheres and Sanfey
2006). People scoring high on Machiavellianism prefer exploitative over cooper-
ative strategies (Wilson et al. 1998), such as opportunistic defection in a bargaining
game (Gunnthorsdottir et al. 2002). And a recent study by Becker et al. (2012)
found that Big 5 traits in general showed small degrees of association with classic
economic preferences, including patience, risk, positive and negative reciprocity,
trust in others, and altruistic tendencies.
    These and many other studies have shown that variance in decision-making
behavior can be partially explained by personality trait questionnaires. However,
this approach is not without certain limitations. Questionnaire research is somewhat
restricted by the degree to which people can access and accurately judge personality
processes. For example, in the classic paper by Nisbett and Wilson (1977), people
demonstrated that they are sometimes unaware of stimuli that lead to their behavior,
unaware of the behavior itself, and unaware of the stimulus → behavior link.
Essentially, people may not know why they act in certain ways, which poses a large
problem for self-report. Additionally, self-report is vulnerable to bias. People tend
to respond in socially desirable ways, may respond randomly, and may change their
responses based on their estimation of an experiment’s purpose (Edwards 1957;
Nichols and Maner 2008). Finally, personality measurements that precede depen-
dent variable measurements could introduce statistical noise. For example, people
who ﬁll out questionnaires that make certain preferences more salient may act
differently in subsequent economic games. Conversely, people who play an eco-
nomic game may respond differently on subsequent questionnaires.
    As an alternative to the questionnaire, we hold that neuroscience methods
uniquely allow for objective measurement of meaningful dispositional differences
that could shed light on the sources of variability in decision-making, particularly in
terms of key economic preferences (Berkman and Falk 2013; Kanai and Rees 2011;
Levallois et al. 2012). This chapter, which details the neural trait approach in
neuroeconomics, is composed of four sections. The ﬁrst outlines the neural trait

approach. The second section highlights contemporary studies that have speciﬁcally
utilized the neural trait approach to explore preferences in decision-making. The
third section highlights future research considerations on the neural trait approach to
individual differences in decision-making. The ﬁnal section outlines certain
opportunities and challenges afforded by this research and the neural trait approach
in general.



11.2     The Neural Trait Approach

We deﬁne a neural trait as a quantiﬁable brain-based characteristic that is stable
over time and capable of influencing economic and/or social preferences. In the
ﬁeld of neuroeconomics, most studies that have employed the neural trait approach
have focused on the characteristics of brain structure or resting state brain activity.
Generally, the neural trait approach involves two steps; (1) indexing
task-independent, brain-based differences and (2) examining whether these neural
trait indices predict behavior in decision-making or processes directly relevant to
decision-making. The ﬁrst and most salient objective of this approach is to deter-
mine sources of behavioral heterogeneity (Braver et al. 2010; Kanai and Rees
2011). As previously stated, economic models of decision-making typically
describe aggregate behavior across individuals (Levallois et al. 2012; Scheres and
Sanfey 2006; Wischniewski et al. 2009). However, individuals can evidence quite
divergent behavior in the same scenarios. Smith and Huettel (2010) note that even
in Kahneman and Tversky’s (1979) work on decision-making biases, sizable
minorities within their sample displayed behavior that directly opposed funda-
mental decision-making phenomena. Traits, and neural traits in particular, can
explain this remarkable amount of variance in decision-making. The second
objective of the neural trait approach is to add an additional level of analysis that
can supplement and be informed by task-dependent analyses of neural and psy-
chological processes (Berkman and Falk 2013). Based on prior literature it can be
stated that neural traits can help researchers infer why differences in
decision-making may occur (though interpretation should be cautious, see the
Cautions and Implications section below). In sum, neural traits associated with
certain functions can demonstrate how and suggest why people differ in their
preferences.



11.3     Neural Trait Measurement

What makes an effective neural trait measure, then? We suggest that such a measure
must meet certain criteria. First, to be able to capture dispositional differences the
neural trait must be stable over time. For example, the measure should demonstrate
high test–retest reliability. Second, the measure should be unique or speciﬁc to that
194                                                                 K. Nash and D. Knoch

individual, or, in other words, highly capable of recognizing a person based on the
measure.
    We focus on two methods that thoroughly fulﬁll these criteria and have been
used in neuroeconomic research. The ﬁrst is resting state electroencephalographic
(rsEEG) activity (for a general description of the EEG method see the chapter of
Debener et al. in this book). Essentially, this method involves recording brain
electrical activity on the scalp when the participant is at rest (as little as 2 min of
recording is needed). As such, rsEEG reflects baseline patterns of brain activity that
are not related to any particular task. Within neural trait research, rsEEG is typically
analyzed by computing power values for different frequency bands. Importantly,
these frequency-based measures of resting EEG activity are relatively stable in the
adult brain, revealing test–retest reliabilities of up to 0.8 over a period of 5 years
(Dunki et al. 2000; Näpflin et al. 2007), are heritable (estimates ranging from 70 to
96 % heritability; see de Geus 2010; Smit et al. 2008; van’t Ent et al. 2009; Zietsch
et al. 2007), and are unique or speciﬁc to the individual (i.e., it is possible to predict
who the individual is based on the particular pattern of EEG activity—at up to a
99 % recognition rate; Dunki et al. 2000; Näpflin et al. 2007). These ﬁndings
comprehensively demonstrate that rsEEG can effectively capture dispositional
differences in neural functioning. Additionally, rsEEG overcomes a signiﬁcant
limitation of neuroscience research—one that is particularly germane to individual
difference research: the limitation of small sample size (Button et al. 2013). Larger
sample sizes are needed to detect individual sources of variability, and rsEEG is a
relatively inexpensive and efﬁcient neuroscience method.
    The second measure that fulﬁlls the criteria for a good neural trait is structural
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain anatomy (for a general description of
the MRI method see the chapters 8c (fMRI), 8d (VBM), and 8e (DTI) in this book).
Neuroanatomical differences can be quantiﬁed through measuring and analyzing
MRI data (i.e., high resolution images of the brain) with gray-matter approaches
(such as voxel based morphometry, VBM, or vertex-based analyses, for example
with the freesurfer image analysis suite) and white-matter approaches (such as
diffusion tensor imaging, DTI). Whereas gray-matter approaches typically yield
regionally speciﬁc estimations of cortical/subcortical volume, thickness, or surface
area (Ashburner and Friston 2000), white-matter approaches quantify features of the
neural connections or pathways in the brain (Basser 1995). The basic notion behind
both gray- and white-matter approaches is that these brain differences reflect dif-
ferent functional or processing capacity (Boyke et al. 2008; DeYoung et al. 2010).
Unsurprisingly, cortical volume (i.e., the combination of cortical thickness and
surface area) is highly stable in the adult brain (DeYoung et al. 2010; Han et al.
2006), heritable (estimates ranging from 80 % heritability; Thompson et al. 2001;
Panizzon et al. 2009) and highly speciﬁc to the individual (Mechelli et al. 2005).
White-matter outcome variables have also demonstrated excellent test–retest reli-
ability (Benson et al. 2007; Buechel et al. 2004) and are highly heritable too
(estimates from 75 to 90 % heritability; Chiang et al. 2009). Much like resting
EEG, then, structural MRI measures are ideal to quantify brain-based
inter-individual differences (Kanai and Rees 2011). Moreover, structural
11   Individual Differences in Decision-Making: A Neural Trait …                   195

measures have the added beneﬁt of being able to image cortical and subcortical
anatomy with a high degree of spatial precision.
   Research utilizing the neural trait approach, either with rsEEG or with structural
MRI, carries with it further advantages. First, because resting EEG and structural
MRI can be measured separately from behavioral performance, researchers can then
measure behavioral performance in more ecologically valid environments—that is,
outside of the MRI scanner or without being hooked up to EEG-electrodes.
Relatedly, the separation of behavioral measurement from neural measurement
permits multiple tasks to be administered to the same set of subjects. Therefore, it is
distinctively possible to link superﬁcially different preferences, such as risk, time,
and social preferences, to some common neural circuitry and/or common psycho-
logical process.



11.4     Neural Trait Research and Decision-Making

In this section, we review a number of studies that applied the neural trait approach
to investigate the sources of individual differences in economic decision-making.
Note that the following explication is not exhaustive. We instead focus on con-
temporary research that has utilized the neural trait approach to investigate sig-
niﬁcant preferences in economic decision-making; namely time preferences and
social preferences.



11.4.1 Time Preferences

Time preferences describe the degree to which a person favors rewards or behav-
ioral options as a function of time (Berns et al. 2007). Generally, people overlook or
‘discount’ future rewards in favor of smaller, sooner rewards, depending on the
amount of delay of the future reward. A reduced preference for sooner rewards is
critical in forgoing immediate temptations to reach longer term goals (Casey et al.
2011; Mischel et al. 2011). Time preferences are highly variable across individuals
(Peters and Büchel 2011). Moreover, such individual differences in time preference
are stable and predict a wide range of impulsive, yet consequential, every-day
behaviors, like smoking, inﬁdelity, and food consumption (Beck and Triplett 2009;
Casey et al. 2011; Mischel et al. 2011; Reimers et al. 2009). However, relatively
little is known about the sources of these individual differences (Olson et al. 2009;
Peters and Büchel 2011; Shamosh et al. 2008). Thus, the neural trait approach
appears well suited to explore such heterogeneity, as was demonstrated in a recent
study by Gianotti et al. (2012). In this study, participants ﬁrst had resting EEG
activity measured. After, participants completed a task in which they made a series
of decisions between smaller–sooner rewards and later–larger rewards that differed
in magnitude and delay. In their analyses, the researchers used a source localization
196                                                                         K. Nash and D. Knoch

technique to identify the brain regions that generated the rsEEG activity
(sLORETA; Pascual-Marqui 2002) and correlated this estimated neural activity
with time preferences. Results demonstrated that approximately 14 % of the vari-
ance in time preferences was explained by rsEEG source localized to the left
DLPFC. Speciﬁcally, lower levels of baseline activity in this region were associated
with increased delay discounting (see Fig. 11.1). Thus, in using a task-independent
measure of baseline neural activity, which allowed quantiﬁcation of a trait-like
neural signature of each individual’s brain function at rest, the authors were able to
explain a sizable degree of heterogeneity in intertemporal choice. Notably, this is
not the only example of using the neural trait approach to predict time preferences.
Bjork et al. (2009) employed structural MRI to measure gray matter volume in
prefrontal regions to determine whether anatomical differences in the PFC predict
behavioral heterogeneity in a similar measure of time preference. Mirroring the
resting EEG ﬁndings, Bjork et al. (2009) found that a greater degree of delay
discounting was associated with reduced PFC cortical volume, including reduced
volume in lateral PFC regions. Similarly, Yu (2012) used whole-brain voxel-based
morphometric analysis to examine white-matter volume and time preferences.
Results demonstrated that delay discounting was negatively associated with lateral
PFC subgyral white-matter volume and positively correlated with
parahippocampal/hippocampal white-matter volume. Olson et al. (2009) used a
similar method and examined the relationship between delay discounting and
white-matter integrity using DTI. They found that delay discounting was negatively
associated with increased white-matter integrity in several regions, including lateral

correlation between delay discount rate and beta 3 activity level in the DLPFC assessed by rsEEG.
Beta 3 activity is associated with increased cortical activity. Higher numbers on the Y-axis indicate
higher delay discounting rates and higher numbers on the X-axis indicate higher levels of resting
brain activity in left DLPFC. On the right locations of the voxels that showed negative signiﬁcant
correlations are indicated in red in a sagittal view of the brain. A anterior; P posterior

PFC regions (Olson et al. 2009). In all four studies, then, higher lateral PFC
functioning capacity (increased resting activity, cortical volume, white-matter
volume, and white-matter integrity) predicted lower levels of delay discounting.
These resting EEG and structural results are further complimentary with studies that
have experimentally modulated lateral PFC functioning. For example, reducing
activity in the left lateral PFC through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
causes an increase in delay discounting (Figner et al. 2010). Because this region has
been related to self-control in other decision-making processes, these ﬁndings thus
converge to support speculation that dispositional differences in the lateral PFC
might reflect differences in a more general ‘self-control capacity’ (p. 6, Gianotti
et al. 2012).



11.4.2 Social Preferences

Social preferences are predominantly deﬁned as the degree to which an individual
positively or negatively accounts for the well-being or material gains and losses of
other people (Fehr 2009). A large body of research demonstrates that people are
heterogeneous in their social preferences, including preferences for cooperation
(Fehr and Gächter 2000), rejection of unfair offers (Güth 1995; Roth 1995), and
altruism (Andreoni and Miller 2002). For example, the DG is regarded as a puta-
tively ‘pure’ measure of prosocial preference (Camerer and Fehr 2002; for an
introduction into behavioral economic games see the Chap. 2 by Civai and Hawes
in this book). In this game, roughly 80 % of proposers do offer more than nothing
to their interaction partner and up to 20 % offer an even-split (Forsythe et al. 1994),
indicating a wide range of social preferences. In the UG, modal offers tend toward a
fair split, yet the mean offer is typically around 40 %, again indicating signiﬁcant
individual variation (Camerer 2003). We thus turn to neural trait research that has
begun to delve into the sources of heterogeneity in social preferences.



11.4.3 Prosocial Behavior and Altruism

Often deﬁned as behavior that beneﬁts another individual or group at a personal
cost to the actor (Camerer 2003; Fehr and Fischbacher 2003; Henrich et al. 2006),
altruism is a strong other-regarding tendency as a large proportion of people help
unrelated strangers (Camerer 2003). However, such altruistic yet costly behavior is
characterized by ‘enormous individual heterogeneity’ (p. 73, Morishima et al.
2012). For example, Andreoni and Miller (2002) found that people could be
classiﬁed into three very different groups based on behavior in a modiﬁed DG; a
purely selﬁsh group, a more strategic group, and a fair group. Similarly, Kurzban
and Houser (2005) found that 63 % of players in a public goods game could be
classiﬁed as conditional cooperators, 13 % as altruists, and 20 % as selﬁsh
198                                                              K. Nash and D. Knoch

free-riders. Nonetheless, variables such as sex, wealth, age, and education are poor
predictors of individual differences in altruistic behavior (Camerer 2003; Henrich
et al. 2006). To ﬁll this empirical gap, Morishima et al. (2012) used structural MRI
to explore whether anatomical differences in the temporo-parietal junction
(TPJ) predicted individual differences in altruism, as measured with dictator and
reciprocity games. The TPJ has been repeatedly linked to perspective-taking—the
ability to account for other peoples’ thoughts, emotions, and goals (Saxe and
Kanwisher 2005; Young et al. 2010). Differences in TPJ structure, and thereby
differences in perspective-taking, were hypothesized to predict altruism, as mea-
sured with a game in which participants allocated money between themselves and
an anonymous partner. The researchers found that increased TPJ volume predicted
an increased tendency to act altruistically (i.e., assign money to their partner at a
personal cost), particularly in situations when the participant was in an advanta-
geous position relative to other individuals (Morishima et al. 2012). Thus, this study
not only provided a link between individual differences in brain structure to pref-
erences for altruism, but it also suggests that altruism is dependent upon an indi-
vidual’s capacity to engage in perspective-taking, as evidenced by TPJ volume.



11.4.4 Costly Punishment

The threat of punishment plays an important role in norm compliance. A key reason
that the threat of punishment is so effective is that many people are willing to
enforce the fairness norm by delivering punishment, even at a cost (Fehr and
Gächter 2000). Unsurprisingly, given that such behavior requires sacriﬁce, pref-
erences for costly punishment behavior are characterized by signiﬁcant variation
(Herrmann et al. 2008). For example, Fischbacher et al. (2013) used a unique
approach in which they examined responders’ reaction times to decisions made in a
modiﬁed UG to characterize heterogeneity in costly punishment behavior. They
found that strictly selﬁsh respondents and respondents who displayed social pref-
erences showed distinct reaction times to unkind and unfair offers. This empirically
demonstrates a large degree of heterogeneity in costly punishment behavior.
Findings from the few attempts to explain sources of such behavioral heterogeneity
have been mixed, however. Gender, income, wealth, and education have low
predictive power that varies strongly according to the idiosyncrasies of the different
study designs (Camerer, 2003). On the other hand, up to 40 % of variation in costly
punishment behavior can be attributed to genetic components (Wallace et al. 2007),
hinting that stable and objective dispositional differences might be uniquely capable
of explaining heterogeneity in costly punishment. Knoch et al. (2010) thus utilized
the neural trait approach to index such stable and objective differences. In their
study, participants ﬁrst had rsEEG activity measured. After, participants then played
as the responder in the UG. As the responder, participants accepted or rejected a
proposed division of 20 CHF from 12 anonymous, ostensibly different interaction
partners. A rejection ensures that both parties get no money at all. Thus, the
11   Individual Differences in Decision-Making: A Neural Trait …                 199

responder can punish the proposer, but at a personal cost. Knoch et al. (2010)
conducted a whole-brain correlational analysis between source localized resting
EEG activity and costly punishment behavior. Results demonstrated that the
propensity to punish was predicted by baseline cortical activity in the right DLPFC.
That is, higher resting state activity in this area predicted higher levels of costly
punishment behavior. Strikingly, this pattern of rsEEG activity explained approx-
imately 50 % of the variance in costly punishment. Because there is considerable
evidence that the lateral PFC is linked to self-control processes (Aron et al. 2003;
Miller and Cohen 2001) and given that costly punishment conflicts with economic
self-interest, the authors surmised that resting state activity in the DLPFC might
predict costly punishment because such activity reflects a capacity to implement
self-control to overcome self-interested choices. This is further supported by brain
stimulation research in which disrupted lateral PFC functioning caused reduced
costly punishment behavior (Baumgartner et al. 2011; Knoch et al. 2008; Knoch
et al. 2006; van’t Wout et al. 2005).



11.4.5 Impartiality and Intergroup Bias

People can and do act with impartiality. This is certainly not always the case,
however, as ingroup bias or favoritism may be the default response (Brewer 1999).
Thus, behavior in an intergroup context can run the gamut from ﬁerce parochialism
to stoic impartiality. In general, personality measures have been relatively poor
predictors of heterogeneity in impartiality and intergroup bias (Hewstone et al.
2002). To better explain sources of individual differences in the propensity for
impartiality, it would appear that more objective individual markers, as afforded by
the neural trait approach, would be more apposite. Recently, Baumgartner et al.
(2013a, b) examined whether impartiality may be explained by structural differ-
ences in the brain. They used structural MRI and measured impartiality by having
participants—in the role of a third-party—view a series of prisoner’s dilemma
interactions between dyads of ingroup and outgroup members. In this game, the
interacting players simultaneously decided whether to cooperate and transfer points
or defect and keep points which were later turned in for real money. The
‘third-party’ participants viewing the interactions could then deliver punishment (or
not). Administering punishment was costly, as participants had to give up points to
strip the other player of their points. Impartiality was computed as the differences
between punishments of ingroup members versus punishment of outgroup members
in situations of unilateral defection. Intriguingly, Baumgartner et al. (2013a, b)
found that increased dmPFC volume was associated with increased impartiality or
fairness (see Fig. 11.2). In addition, Baumgartner and colleagues used the dmPFC
volume to split participants into three separate groups (low, medium, and high
dmPFC) and examined punishment levels of both ingroup and outgroup defectors.
As expected, these three groups demonstrated strong differences in impartiality.
Those with low dmPFC volumes demonstrated ingroup favoritism (reduced
200                                                                          K. Nash and D. Knoch




Fig. 11.2 Adapted from Baumgartner et al. (2013a, b): On the left the scatter plot shows the
signiﬁcant negative correlation between the partiality score and gray-matter volume in the
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), which is adjusted for several covariates (e.g., age and
brain size, see article for details). High values on the partiality score indicate that third-parties
strongly differed in the punishment of outgroup and ingroup perpetrators, whereas low values
indicate that third-parties demonstrated an impartial punishment pattern, i.e., they equally punished
outgroup and ingroup perpetrators. On the right locations of voxels in the DMPFC that showed
signiﬁcant negative correlations with the partiality score are indicated in yellow color in a sagittal
view of the brain


punishment of the ingroup) and outgroup prejudice (increased punishment of the
outgroup). Those with medium levels of dmPFC volume demonstrated ingroup
favoritism but not outgroup prejudice. Finally, those with high levels of dmPFC
volume demonstrated equal treatment of ingroup and outgroup defectors (i.e.,
ingroup perpetrators were punished just as strongly as outgroup perpetrators). Thus,
heterogeneity in impartiality was tightly bound to dmPFC volume. These ﬁndings
point to a potential psychological mechanism as, much like the TPJ, the dmPFC has
been repeatedly implicated in social cognition and perspective-taking processes
(Adolphs 2003; Van Overwalle 2009). Thus, the ability to overcome ingroup
favoritism and outgroup prejudice may depend on the capacity to engage in
perspective-taking equally for ingroups and outgroups—a capacity that may be
largely determined by dmPFC volume.



11.4.6 Deception

Lying and deception are ubiquitous in social interactions. Typically, people deceive
others for personal gain, but the propensity to deceive is highly variable amongst
individuals (Gino and Pierce 2009; Kashy and DePaulo 1996). Attempts to explain
this heterogeneity have primarily focused on self-reported personality traits (e.g.,
11   Individual Differences in Decision-Making: A Neural Trait …                  201

Phillips et al. 2011). However, personality traits tend to have low predictive power
of deception (DePaulo 2004). A neural trait approach might prove a better pre-
dictive tool. As evidence of this, Baumgartner et al. (2013a, b) recently used source
localization of resting EEG to examine whether trait levels of neural activation
might explain differences in deceiving others. They used an ecologically valid
measure of self-initiated deception with real, monetary consequences. In this task,
participants promised whether or not they would return money to real partners in a
trust game, but were later given the opportunity to break that promise (i.e., keep the
investment). A cluster analysis revealed three groups; (1) dishonest subjects that
had uniformly high promise rates but uniformly low return rates; (2) moderately
dishonest subjects that had relatively lower promise rates and moderate return rates;
and (3) honest subjects that had high promise rates and high return rates.
Heterogeneity in deception was thus easily discernible. In their primary analyses,
they found that the tendency to deceive was associated with reduced resting state
activation in the anterior insula. The higher the neural baseline activation in this
area is the lower individuals’ propensity to deceive. This resting state activation in
the insula accounted for 23 % of the variance in deceptive behavior. Furthermore,
they found that the same pattern of baseline anterior insula activation that was
associated with reduced deception was also associated with trait levels of negative
affect and dispositional tendencies to avoid aversive emotional situations. As such,
these ﬁndings are a good example of the power of the neural trait approach as they
suggest who lies and who remains honest. One might primarily expect that people
who are less inclined to deceive have strong prosocial preferences, as opposed to
those who deceive, an expectation which future research could explore. This study
revealed a unique relationship, however. Honesty was related to more resting
activity in a brain area associated with mapping internal bodily states and in rep-
resenting emotional arousal and conscious feelings (Craig 2009). Thus, people with
heightened baseline insula activity may be predisposed towards honesty because
their hyperactive emotional system could make a deceptive act too aversive. In this
case, the examination of neural traits indicated predisposing psychological pro-
cesses that may have otherwise been unknown or considered relatively unimportant.
    In sum, across these studies, even in the highly complex domain of social
preferences, neural traits are demonstrably capable of explaining behavioral
heterogeneity in decision-making. In the next section, we explore how the neural
trait approach may be adapted for future research.



11.5     The Neural Trait Approach in Future Research

This chapter has explored the neural trait approach to explaining dispositional
differences in decision-making with a particular focus on time and social prefer-
ences. In addition to explaining behavioral heterogeneity in decision-making,
however, we further contend that the neural trait approach holds promise as a key
component in fuller research designs.
202                                                              K. Nash and D. Knoch

    For example, prior research has primarily emphasized contextual or situational
factors that determine decision-making behavior or explain economic preferences.
Given the twin advantages of stability and objectivity, neural traits have the ability
to powerfully augment contextual research by uncovering brain-based individual
differences and examining whether these differences interact with situational vari-
ables. Such an approach is not new, as it was classically formulated by Kurt Lewin
in his now famous equation describing (B)ehavior as a function of (P)erson × (E)
nvironment (Lewin 1946). We argue that modern forms of this ‘equation’ could
include neural trait measures of (P) in combination with experimental manipula-
tions (E) known to impact decision-making behavior (B). For example, subtle or
even subliminal cues can shift behavior from selﬁsh to prosocial behavior and vice
versa (Bargh et al. 2001; Bateson et al. 2006; Rand et al. 2012). Neural traits
associated with differences in self- and other-regarding preferences should moderate
reactions to economic and social cues. That is, neural traits associated with
self-regarding preferences might predict reactions to monetary cues; whereas neural
traits associated with other-regarding preferences might predict reactions to social
cues (see also Declerck et al. 2013, for similar reasoning). Future research para-
digms that combine neural trait measures and situational manipulations could
deepen our understanding of decision-making processes.
    Future research may also utilize the neural trait approach as a unique component
in fuller analyses of genetic → brain → behavior pathways. In parallel with the
neural trait approach, a number of researchers have examined individual differences
in decision-making by assessing potential genetic contributions (e.g., Boettiger
et al. 2007; Cesarini et al. 2009; Kuhnen and Chiao 2009; for an overview on genes
and human decision-making, see also Chap. 4 in this book). The question is, how
do these genes then affect behavior? More speciﬁcally, what are the mechanisms?
The answer, proposed as the intermediate phenotype model, is that genes impact
behavior through neural mechanisms (Meyer-Lindenberg and Weinberger 2006).
The basic notion is that genes influence an individual’s behavior through their
effects on the brain. To be an effective, brain-based intermediate phenotype, certain
criteria have been articulated. Central amongst these criteria are the characteristics
of stability and heritability (Gottesman and Gould 2003; Green et al. 2008). As
noted previously, resting EEG activity and structural MRI are both highly stable
and heritable. Neural traits are thus ideal intermediate phenotypes.
    As an example, Gianotti et al. (2012) also employed the intermediate phenotype
approach in the aforementioned time preference research. In addition to measuring
resting EEG, these researchers genotyped participants on the COMT Val158Met
polymorphism, which has been related to dopamine levels in the PFC and delay
discounting in prior research (Boettiger et al. 2007; Paloyelis et al. 2010). Results
demonstrated that participants with more Val alleles (greater COMT activity and
lower dopamine levels in the PFC) exhibited greater delay discounting. This effect
was mediated by the baseline activation levels in the left lateral PFC: Higher
numbers of Val alleles lead to lower baseline activation which, in turn, biases
choices towards greater impatience. More studies such as this could provide a
mechanistic understanding of the contribution of speciﬁc gene variants to individual

11.6     Cautions and Implication

One should be cognizant of potential issues involved in the neural trait approach.
Detecting neural traits that relate to certain behaviors can often involve examining
activity throughout the entire brain. Thus, the probability of ﬁnding a spurious
relationship is greatly inflated unless the researcher uses appropriate corrections for
multiple testing. One should also be aware that there is a temptation to
over-interpret neural trait ﬁndings. By relating decision-making behavior to certain
brain areas, there is an inclination to ‘guess’ at the psychological process that
mediates the brain—behavior link. Indeed, this potential was often discussed in this
chapter as an advantage of the approach. To be clear, however, inferring the psy-
chological mechanism is more appropriate when a brain region has been tightly
linked to speciﬁc, germane functioning. To address this issue, one can also provide
204                                                                     K. Nash and D. Knoch

supplementary evidence. Recall the deception research in which Baumgartner et al.
(2013a, b) found that the same pattern of baseline anterior insula activation that
predicted reduced deception also predicted higher levels of trait negative affect.
This supports their inference that people with high resting activity in the anterior
insula are predisposed to be honest due to a hyperactive emotional system at rest
which could make a deceptive act too bothersome.
   There are also a number of exciting broad implications. For example, even
though neural traits are highly stable, they may not be immutable. Indeed, enduring
changes can be made to neural structures and mechanisms through training. For
example, techniques such as neurofeedback, meditation, or repeated practice of
certain skills have the capacity to increase cortical volume or cortical baseline
activity in speciﬁc brain regions (e.g., Ghaziri et al. 2013; Lazar et al. 2005;
Takeuchi et al. 2010). Thus, targeted training manipulations of speciﬁc neural traits
might allow researchers to effect longer lasting changes to even the most complex
of preferences or decision-making behaviors, such as adherence to social norms.
   Finally, we propose that the neural trait approach has the ability to synthesize
decision-making phenomena that, on the surface, appear distinct but in reality may
be partly explained by the same or similar neural traits. For example, several studies
outlined above demonstrate that dispositional differences in the DLPFC predict
behavioral heterogeneity in decision-making preferences; i.e., heterogeneity in time
preferences (Gianotti et al. 2012), risk preferences (Gianotti et al. 2009), costly
punishment (Knoch et al. 2010), and norm compliance (Spitzer et al. 2007;
Steinbeis et al. 2012). Given that this region has been strongly implicated in
self-control (Cohen and Lieberman 2010; Coutlee and Huettel 2012; Figner et al.,
2010; Heatherton and Wagner 2011; Miller and Cohen 2001), it is a tantalizing
possibility that these disparate decision-making domains could be linked to a
common neural trait and/or psychological capacity. Future research could take
advantage of the neural trait approach to potentially demonstrate a shared basis
between risk, time, and social preferences.
