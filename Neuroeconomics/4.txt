Genes and Human Decision-Making

Abstract The present chapter aims to give a concise overview of the genetics of
human decision-making. The focus will be on studies that can be considered within
the ﬁeld of neuroeconomics. Although genetic studies in neuroeconomics are scarce
to date, interest in and use of, genetic designs is increasing. This popularity is based
on the huge potential of genetic research. The collection of data is more naturalistic as
it is not restricted to the laboratory, and genes convey information on brain meta-
bolism relevant to decision-making. The widespread belief, that genetic information
is already determined before birth and therefore, is not subject to influence or change
over the lifespan, has recently been revised. The young discipline of epigenetics has
shown that environmental factors can influence the activity of genes throughout life.
Therefore, investigating the interaction between genes and environment on a
behavioral, as well as a, molecular level is a promising direction for research. The
empirical neuroeconomics studies published to date have adopted a candidate gene
approach. This means researchers have identiﬁed theory-driven, distinct gene loci
relevant for decision-making in economic contexts, from the literature. These pioneer
studies are reviewed and discussed below. For those readers who are not familiar with
molecular genetics, we recommend the chapter on genetics contained in the methods
section of this book as a complementary introduction.

4.1    The Molecular Genetic Basis of Human
       Decision-making

Every day we make numerous decisions that influence both our current actions and
which can also have strong implications for our future. The choice between cheese
cake and apple pie for dessert is obviously not a big thing, but the decision whether
or not to invest in high-risk stocks promising enormous proﬁt, may lead to wealth
or to ﬁnancial ruin. From the media and from our own observations, we are well
aware that there is great variability in the way people make their decisions. There is,
in fact, much greater variability in decision-making behavior between—rather than
within—people. This means that individuals typically show a rather stable pattern
of behavior—referred to as personality. Some people are notoriously prone to
making risky decisions, whereas others tend to procrastinate over a decision and
make their choices after considering the alternatives very carefully. Impulsivity and
risk-taking on the one hand, and anxiety and reflectiveness on the other, seem to
represent two opposing aspects of personality in decision-making (Zaleskiewicz
2001). However, often our decisions do not only influence our own fortune, but also
that of others. Man, as a social individual, takes decisions that also have conse-
quences for others and in the same way our own decisions are influenced by the
opinions and actions of our fellow human beings (Kaplan and Miller 1987).
Therefore, personality traits like cooperativeness, characterizing a person’s attitude
towards prosocial behavior, are also of great interest to the investigation of human
decision-making. It is presumed that the genetic underpinnings of such personality
traits build the biological basis for stable patterns in decision-making that seem to
be rather invariant across situations and, therefore, allow the prediction of a deci-
sion even in rather speciﬁc situations. Of course these predictions will not be perfect
because we know, e.g., from laboratory experiments, that instructions can mold
performance (Wickelgren 1977; see the discussion of the speed-accuracy-tradeoff
in simple decisions in Chap. 14 of this book) and that states (e.g., current mood)
also have a strong impact on decision-making. However, personality traits are
highly heritable (up to 50 %; e.g., Tellegen et al. 1988). For the reasons outlined
above, genes related to personality prove excellent candidate genes for human
decision-making.
    Even before neuroeconomics was established as an autonomous scientiﬁc dis-
cipline, neuroscientists had used genetic approaches for investigating human
decision-making. This work was in part triggered by an interest in psychiatric and
neurological diseases in which decision-making in patients is strongly impaired.
Those patients with brain lesions in clearly deﬁned neural structures, e.g., of the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex, offered insights into brain regions relevant for
decision-making. A famous paradigm used in such studies is the IOWA Gambling
Task, which measures the ability of a person to prefer constant small rewards under
low risk of losing money, compared to seldom occurring high rewards under high
risk of losing money (IGT; Bechara et al. 2000). The ventromedial prefrontal cortex
is essential in impulsive decision-making, with patients with lesions in this area
4 Genes and Human Decision-Making                                                   69

demonstrating a preference for smaller immediate rewards, rather than for larger,
delayed rewards. The same pattern of behavior is observed in individuals with a
drug addiction, a disorder marked by a lack of impulse control (e.g., Ert et al. 2013;
van der Plas et al. 2009). To date there exist numerous genetic association studies in
different patient samples and in samples of healthy subjects, that try to explain
differences in IGT performance by means of candidate gene polymorphisms. The
serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), an insertion/deletion
polymorphism marked by the presence or absence of 43 base pairs in the promoter
region of the serotonin transporter gene, has been most extensively studied in this
context. Subjects with at least a deletion on one chromosome (genotypes SS and
SL) were referred to as S-allele carriers and showed a threefold decrease in mRNA
expression compared to subjects with no deletion on either chromosome (genotype
LL) (Lesch et al. 1996). In a sample of N = 885 healthy Chinese college students,
subjects homozygous for the S-allele had signiﬁcantly lower IGT scores in the ﬁrst
40 trials than L-allele carriers (He et al. 2010). The IGT task comprises 5 blocks
with 20 trials each. The ﬁrst two blocks (trials 1–40) indicate decisions under
uncertainty, whereas blocks 3–5 represent decisions under risk. The main effect of
5-HTTLPR on IGT performance could not be replicated in healthy Caucasian
samples (Lage et al. 2011; Stoltenberg and Vandever 2010). In patients with
obsessive compulsive disorders, da Rocha et al. (2008) reported signiﬁcantly lower
IGT scores in S-allele carriers, however, in contrast to the study by He et al. (2010),
only in the third, fourth, and ﬁfth blocks, i.e., those blocks related to impulsive
decision-making.
    The IGT has strong parallels to research questions in neuroeconomics, where
decisions under ambiguity and under risk are of scientiﬁc interest. Neuroscientists
also have a long tradition in differentiating subcomponents of the decision-making
process by means of biological variables. Cognitive processes related to informa-
tion processing, memory, and executive control are the prevailing dependent
variables. The best supported gene locus with respect to working memory capacity
is the COMT Val158Met polymorphism, located in exon 158 of the catecholamine-
O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene. COMT degrades monoamines (e.g., dopamine)
in the synaptic cleft. The catabolizing activity of Met-allele carriers is about three-
to fourfold lower than that of Val-allele carriers (Lachman et al. 1996). The
Met-allele is associated with higher working memory capacity and better executive
control abilities more generally (Goldberg and Weinberger 2008). However—and
of interest for neuroeconomics—the Val-allele is related to higher positive emo-
tionality (PE), as compared to the Met-allele (Montag et al. 2012; Reuter and
Hennig 2005; Wacker et al. 2012). PE comprises personality traits like extraversion
and novelty seeking, as well as other characteristics related to risk-taking and
reward-seeking (e.g., Krebs et al. 2009; Smillie 2013).
    These examples of genetic association studies have direct implications for the
decision processes under investigation in neuroeconomics. Moreover, the gene
markers outlined above are among the best studied polymorphisms in neuroeco-
nomic research. It must be noted that we identiﬁed thousands of genetic association
studies from different disciplines in the literature relating candidate gene loci to
70                                                               M. Reuter and C. Montag

various phenotypes. However, for most of these polymorphisms the proof of
functionality is missing. The 5-HTTLPR and the COMT Val158met polymor-
phisms related to altered mRNA expression and differences in metabolic enzyme
activity, respectively, are laudable exceptions.



4.2     Molecular Genetics in Neuroeconomics

4.2.1    Ultimatum Game (UG)

Behavioral economists have developed paradigms—so called games—that permit
the investigation of human decision-making under experimentally controlled con-
ditions (for an in depth overview of games in neuroeconomic research see Chap. 2
by Civai and Hawes in this book). One of the most prominent paradigms in neu-
roeconomics is the Ultimatum Game (UG), which provides a framework for the
study of prosocial behavior in two players interacting anonymously with each other;
Player 1 (the proposer) has to split an endowment with player 2 (the responder).
Player 2 can either accept or reject the offer from player 1. If player 2 accepts the
offer, the money is split as proposed by player 1. Should player 2 reject the offer,
both players receive nothing (Camerer 2003). Thus, the UG represents a classic
“take it or leave it” situation. The responder has to either accept the offer of the
proposer in its present form or must reject it outright. There is no opportunity for
negotiation. The UG played in the laboratory perfectly parallels real life situations.
Often we are confronted with such “take it or leave it” situations. For example, if
we apply for a job in public service where income brackets are ﬁxed, we have to
either accept the salary or leave it and look for a job on the free market. The Greek
debt cut is a prime example of a real life UG. A group of banks and investors in
Greek government debt had the choice between exchanging their debt for new
bonds worth about 70 % less than the original, or encounter the total breakdown of
the Greek ﬁnance system, resulting in the complete loss of their invested money.
    There is a general agreement in the literature that responder behavior in the UG
represents fairness preference. If an offer is judged as unfair we are likely to
dispense with the offer altogether rather than be satisﬁed with a small proportion of
the pie. Punishing a proposer for an unfair offer (i.e., a low offer that is greater than
zero) is not rational and contradicts economists’ view on man as a homo eco-
nomicus. It is suggested that the homo economicus is merely guided by self-interest
and always tries to maximize his proﬁt. In order to do so, he only makes strictly
rational decisions (Persky 1995). However, the behavior of the proposer is far more
complex than that of the responder. It is a mixture of fairness preference on the one
hand and strategic consideration on the other hand: to be a social human being
capable of taking the perspective of the responder (theory of mind) and strategic
considerations (maximize own proﬁt while minimizing the risk of being punished
for an unfair offer).
4 Genes and Human Decision-Making                                                   71

    An initial twin study from Sweden showed that more than 40 % of the variation
in subjects’ rejection behavior in the UG, is explained by additive genetic effects
(Wallace et al. 2007). These data underline the strong genetic basis for the etiology
of fairness preferences. However, the heritability estimates for proposer behavior
were negligible in this study. To date, two existing molecular genetic studies have
tried to identify candidate genes for behavior in the UG. The ﬁrst study was
published by Zhong et al. (2010), who found that the dopamine D4 receptor
(DRD4) gene explains at least a small proportion of variance in the UG responder
behavior. The DRD4 gene consists of 3400 base pairs (bp) and is located at
chromosome 11p15.5. In exon III of this gene a highly polymorphic variable
number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism has been identiﬁed, which is
characterized by a repetitive sequence of 48 bp (between 2 and 11 repeats) (van Tol
et al. 1992). Three alleles are most common; the 2-repeat, the 4-repeat, and the
7-repeat; the ancestral 4-repeat allele is most frequently occurring across all eth-
nicities. In Caucasians, the 7-repeat is more frequent than the 2-repeat allele.
However, in Asians the 7-repeat allele is extremely rare and is typically not con-
sidered in Asian genetic association studies.
    Besides reported associations between the DRD4 exon III polymorphism and
various phenotypes related to decision-making behavior, like impulsivity, novelty
seeking, gambling behavior and attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
the functionality of this polymorphism has been further demonstrated (Strobel et al.
1999; Ebstein et al. 1996; Eisenegger et al. 2010; Nikolaidis and Gray 2010).
The VNTR region of the DRD4 gene encodes a portion of the third intracellular
loop region of the transcribed receptor protein that spans the nerve cell membrane
and mediates interaction with second messenger proteins. The 2-repeat allele shows
a 50 % reduction in the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), as
compared with the 4-repeat and 7-repeat alleles (Asghari et al. 1995). Regarding
decision-making behavior in the UG, Zhong et al. (2010) reported that carriers of
the 4/4 genotype stated a 25 % higher minimum acceptable offer in the role of the
second mover, as compared with carriers of the 2/4 and 2/2 genotypes. Notably,
these results came from a Chinese sample, where the 7-repeat allele is very rare and
was therefore not considered in the analysis. The authors did not ﬁnd an association
between the DRD4 exon III polymorphism and the UG proposer behavior. This is
in line with the fact that there are no heritability estimates for UG proposer behavior
available in the literature to date. Although Zhong et al. reported a signiﬁcant
association between the DRD4 gene and fairness preference as assessed by the UG,
the proportion of explained variance is rather small. This is typical for quantitative
traits and underlines the necessity of identifying further genetic variants that
influence behavior in the UG. With this aim in mind, a second genetic association
study focusing on the dopaminergic system’s influence on behavior in the UG was
devised (Reuter et al. 2013). The DRD2 receptor gene has been linked to various
facets of prosocial behaviors like cooperation, attachment style, mentoring, paternal
parenting, and positive emotionality, to name but a few (Walter et al. 2011; Gillath
et al. 2008; Shanahan et al. 2007; Lucht et al. 2006; Reuter et al. 2006). Two
polymorphisms, for which functionality has been established, are most investigated
72                                                             M. Reuter and C. Montag

in genetic association studies; the DRD2/ANKK1-Taq Ia (rs1800497) and the
DRD2 C957T (rs6277) polymorphisms. The DRD2/ANKK1-Taq Ia polymorphism
is a restriction fragment polymorphism on chromosome 11 at q22–q23 (Noble
2003). Three genotypes of the dopamine DRD2/ANNK1-Taq Ia locus can be dif-
ferentiated: The A1A1 genotype (also referred to as TT genotype), the A1A2
genotype (also referred to as TC genotype), and the A2A2 genotype (CC genotype).
Due to the small prevalence of the A1A1 genotype (3 % in healthy Caucasians),
A1A1 and A1A2 subjects are commonly grouped as A1 + subjects, whereas A2A2
subjects are referred to as A1– subjects. The prevalence of at least one A1 allele
(A1 + group) leads to a reduction of up to 30 % in D2 receptor density (e.g.,
Pohjalainen et al. 1998). The direct impact of the DRD2/ANKK1-Taq Ia poly-
morphism on D2 receptor density has recently been questioned, since this single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is located about 10 kb downstream of the DRD2
gene, within a protein-coding region of the adjacent ANKK1 gene (Neville et al.
2004). Zhang et al. (2007) investigated 23 SNPs within the DRD2 gene and found a
decreased expression of the short splice variant of the D2 receptor compared to the
long splice variant, caused by two intronic SNPs (rs2283265 and rs1076560).
Interestingly, in the study by Zhang et al. (2007) the minor alleles of the two SNPs
show strong linkage disequilibrium with the A1 allele of the DRD2/ANKK1-Taq Ia
polymorphism (D′ = 0.855). These data indicate that, due to linkage, the
DRD2/ANKK1-Taq Ia polymorphism is indeed a marker for dopamine receptor
density.
    The above-mentioned study by Reuter et al. (2013) replicates the ﬁndings by
Zhong et al. (2010). In this study, the 4/4 genotype was associated with signiﬁ-
cantly higher minimum acceptable offers (20 % higher) as compared to carriers
without the 4/4 genotype and, similar to the Zhong et al. study, the DRD4 exon III
polymorphism was not related to the proposer behavior. In addition, Reuter et al.
detected an association between a haplotype block, spanning 15 kb of the
DRD2/ANKK1 region, consisting of the rs18000497 (also known as
DRD2/ANKK1-Taq Ia) and rs2283265 SNPs, and the ﬁrst mover offer in the UG.
Carriers of at least one TT haplotype offered signiﬁcantly less money in the UG
(ﬁrst mover-proposals) than carriers without a TT haplotype. This haplotype effect
explains about 6 % of the variance in proposer behavior. The TT haplotype indi-
cates that a subject has, at least on one chromosome, the minor alleles of both gene
variants. Both minor alleles have been associated with lower DRD2 receptor
density or decreased relative expression of DRD2s mRNA respectively
(Pohjalainen et al. 1998; Zhang et al. 2007). On the other hand the
second-mover-behavior was not related to genetic variations in the DRD2/ANKK1
region. One may wonder why there is a positive molecular genetic association with
proposer behavior in the UG, when heritability estimates from a twin study suggest
zero heritability for this distinct behavior (Reuter et al. 2013; Wallace et al. 2007).
This is indeed a contradiction. However, the same standards apply to both quan-
titative genetic studies (twin studies) and molecular genetic studies: only an inde-
pendent replication can reduce the probability of false positive or false negative
4 Genes and Human Decision-Making                                                  73

ﬁndings. While the DRD4 results were successfully replicated, it remains to be
clariﬁed whether replication of the twin and the DRD2-proposer data is possible.
   The DRD4 exon III effect is unambiguously related to fairness preference (re-
sponder behavior, i.e., size of minimum acceptable offer), whereas the
DRD2/ANKK1 effect is far more complicated to explain. As described above, the
proposer behavior constitutes a mixture of fairness preference and strategic con-
sideration. Future experiments investigating the UG and the related dictator game
(DG) in a within-subject design could disentangle these two facets of proposer
behavior. In the DG two anonymous players interact with each other. However, the
“interaction” is limited to the ﬁrst mover. He has to split a certain amount of money
between himself and the other player. In contrast to the payoff in the UG, which is
dependent on the acceptance/rejection of the ﬁrst mover’s proposal by the second
mover, the ﬁrst mover in the DG (for a full description of the dictator game, please
see Chap. 2 by Civai and Hawes in this book), also known as “the dictator”, makes
a proposal that is implemented independently of the second mover, i.e., the second
mover cannot reject the dictator’s offer. The identiﬁcation of distinct gene loci
related to the proposals in the UG and in the dictator game would help to clarify this
issue.



4.2.2    Dictator Game (DG)

As mentioned above, the decision-making process of the dictator in the DG is
assumed to reflect prosocial behavior (generosity; altruism; the dictator has not to
fear punishment for an unfair offer) and is therefore more straightforward to
interpret than the ambiguous ﬁrst mover behavior in the UG. Whereas genetic
association studies in the UG concentrate on dopaminergic gene loci, so far all
available studies on the dictator game report associations with the classic prosocial
hormones, vasopressin, and oxytocin. Vasopressin and oxytocin are phylogeneti-
cally very old neuropeptides, consisting of nine amino acids (they are thus referred
to as nonapeptides). The two hormones differ only in two amino acids. Invertebrates
also possess antecedent forms of oxytocin and vasopressin, which indicates the
evolutionary importance of these two hormones. Their relevance for prosocial
behavior was impressively demonstrated when differences in social behaviors and
related biological systems between prairie (Microtus ochrogaster) and meadow
voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) were discovered (Lim et al. 2004). These two
kinds of voles, although from the same species, are marked by extreme differences
in pair bonding and fostering of offspring. Male prairie voles are monogamous, are
engaged in parental care and exhibit a stable social structure, whereas the closely
related meadow voles are solitary, polygamous, and do not care about rearing the
offspring. Lim and colleagues discovered that the arginine vasopressin 1a receptor
(AVPR1a) mRNA expression in the ventral forebrain is signiﬁcantly higher in the
monogamous prairie voles than in the promiscuous meadow voles. Interestingly,
the insertion of a viral AVPR1a gene vector into the ventral forebrain of male
74                                                              M. Reuter and C. Montag

meadow voles reduced promiscuity and increased preference for an individual
partner. This same genetic region was the focus of interest in the ﬁrst human genetic
studies investigating social behavior by means of the dictator game. In a seminal
study of 203 university students who played an online version of the DG, Knafo
et al. (2008) demonstrated that allocation of funds in the Dictator Game (DG) was in
part determined by length of the arginine vasopressin 1a (AVPR1a) RS3 promoter
repeat region. The RS3 polymorphism is one of three promoter region
microsatellites (the other two are (GT)25 and RS1). Microsatellites represent small
repeats of DNA bases, also known as simple sequence repeats (SSR). All three
polymorphisms in this study were SSRs, i.e., repetitive DNA sequences charac-
terized by a short base-pair motif that is repeated several to many times in tandem
(e.g., CACACACA). It has been demonstrated that such SSRs can exert an influ-
ence on the translation and transcription of a gene (Beckmann et al. 2007). In the
study by Knafo et al. dictators with short versions (308–325 bp) of the AVPR1a
RS3 repeat allocated signiﬁcantly smaller amounts of money to the other player
than participants with long versions (327–343 bp). Additionally, the length of the
RS3 repeat region was related to the amounts of AVPR1a mRNA expression in
hippocampal postmortem specimens. Long AVPR1a RS3 repeats were associated
with higher AVPR1a hippocampal messenger RNA levels than short RS3 repeats.
This proof of functionality (although demonstrated in brain tissue of only n = 15
individuals) shows that the association of the AVPR1a RS3 polymorphism is not
correlative in nature, but that this genetic variant has an influence on central nervous
vasopressin receptor metabolism. Results indicate that higher mRNA levels of the
APPR1a receptor are related to more generous behavior. In a further study using a
modiﬁed version of the DG, the initial positive association between AVPR1a RS3
polymorphism and generosity was replicated in a sample of 3.5-year-old twins
(Avinun et al. 2011). Children were required to allocate sticker charts instead of
money, as in adult games. The ﬁndings demonstrate that prosocial behaviors
develop earlier in life than is usually expected. Preschoolers at the age of 3.5
already behave socially.
    A third study by the same group tested the influence of the oxytocin receptor
gene on behavior in the DG (Israel et al. 2009). The human OXTR gene is located
on chromosome 3p25.3 spanning approximately 19 kbp, and consists of three
introns and four exons (Inoue et al. 1994). The rationale for extending the search for
prosocial genes to the oxytocin system is straightforward. Independent studies have
demonstrated that both vasopressin and oxytocin promote social behaviors in dif-
ferent mammalian species including humans (for an overview see Ebstein et al.
2009). Vasopressin and oxytocin exert overlapping functions, in part caused by
mutual effects on their respective receptors. This is possible because both hormones
seem to have comparable receptor afﬁnities (e.g., Landgraf and Neumann 2004;
Ragnauth et al. 2004; Pedersen and Boccia 2006).
    Israel et al. (2009) investigated N = 203 Israeli students with the DG and
genotyped for 15 single tagging SNPs across the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR).
Three of these SNPs showed an association with the allocations of the dictator, of
which rs1042778 exhibited the strongest effect. Carriers of the G allele (genotypes
4 Genes and Human Decision-Making                                                    75

GG and GT) as compared to the T allele carriers (genotype TT), split their
endowments more generously. Noteworthy, the positive effects of rs1042778 were
replicated in an independent study of N = 98 female participants (Israel et al. 2009).
Unfortunately these ﬁndings were not replicated in a sample of N = 684 Swedish
twins (Apicella et al. 2010).



4.2.3    Trust

Trust is the prerequisite for all successful social interactions, no matter whether
these take place on a dyadic (lovers, couples, friends) or on a more complex level
(groups, companies, societies, countries) (e.g., Zak and Knack 2001). From an
evolutionary perspective, trust is adaptive and has promoted the development of the
human species (Kümmerli and Brown 2010). Of relevance to neuroeconomics,
studies exist that suggest trust is related to the prosperity of societies (Knack and
Keefer 1997). Trust behavior and altruism alike can be subsumed under the term
“prosocial behaviors”. Therefore, it is not surprising that similar biological systems
are involved in altruism and trust behavior. A seminal study by Kosfeld et al.
(2005) found that administration of nasal oxytocin increases trust in humans and
that this association was not related to risk proneness. In a placebo-controlled
pharmacological study, they used the Trust Game. This famous economic game is
played in the laboratory and represents a one-shot interaction between two
anonymous interaction partners. Participants were randomly assigned the roles of
either an investor or a trustee. Both start the game with an initial endowment
(monetary units, MU). In the ﬁrst stage of the game, the investor can send any even
number of MUs to the trustee. The amount sent by the investor is tripled by the
experimenter. Then, the trustee decides how much money to return to the investor.
Any back transfer between 0 MU and the maximum amount available to the trustee
is feasible. To obtain measures of trust and trustworthiness (i.e., the size of the back
transfer) for each participant, the trust game, in some versions, is played under role
uncertainty. First, each player makes the decision in the role of the investor and
subsequently must decide as a trustee, how many MUs to send back for any
possible amount sent by the investor. After all decisions have been made, a ran-
domization device determines which player in a given pair actually had the role of
the investor and which player had the role of the trustee. Players’ decisions were
then implemented and subjects were paid according to their decisions (for a full

Civai and Hawes in this book).
    One may argue that the data of Kosfeld and colleagues show that administration
of oxytocin increases trust, but that this laboratory experiment does not reflect a
natural setting in which no drugs are consumed. However, in addition to the main
effect of drug (placebo vs. oxytocin), the data also show large variability in the
amount of trust in the placebo condition. A genetic approach may be adopted to
investigate this variability in behavior under natural conditions (i.e., free of drug
76                                                               M. Reuter and C. Montag

intake). A Swedish twin study of more than 2000 twin pairs showed that trust is
indeed heritable. Heritability estimates were 0.33 for males and 0.39 for females
(Oskarsson et al. 2012). However, it must be noted that trust was assessed via a
self-report measure, using one single item (“Generally speaking, would you say that
most people can be trusted, or that you can’t be too careful in dealing with peo-
ple?”). If oxytocin does play a role in trust behavior, as demonstrated by Kosfeld
et al. (2005), then it is likely that genetic variants of the oxytocin system are related
to individual differences in trust behavior. The ﬁrst study investigating polymor-
phisms on the OXTR gene was conducted by Apicella et al. (2010). In their study
(outlined above), they investigated both the DG and the Trust Game. The authors
did not ﬁnd an association between any of the nine OXTR SNPs under investigation
and participant’s behavior in the trust game. In another trust study by Krueger et al.
(2012), a SNP in intron 3 of OXTR (rs53576), characterized by an adenine (A) to
guanine (G) transition, was related to trust behavior but not to trustworthiness, in a
sample of N = 108 US students. Participants with the homozygous GG genotype
showed higher trust behavior than individuals with at least one A-allele (genotypes
AG or AA). This ﬁnding is in line with another study reporting higher behavioral
and dispositional empathy in carriers of the GG genotype as compared to the
A-allele carriers (genotypes AA or AG; Rodrigues et al. 2009). Unfortunately there
exists no test of functionality for the rs53576 SNP so far. In a trust study of N = 100
healthy Caucasian subjects, the present authors tested nine SNPs—mainly in the
promoter region of the OXTR gene—for an association with trust behavior (Reuter
et al. 2009). Haplotype analyses (a mathematical method from bioinformatics used
in genetics to look for a putative linkage between several SNPs located in close
proximity on the same chromosome) revealed a 6-SNP haplotype block or a 3-SNP
haplotype block, dependent on the mathematical algorithm used to estimate the
haplotypes. The smaller haplotype was included within the larger haplotype. The
6-SNP haplotype was obtained by a more liberal haplotype estimation method.
Both haplotypes were signiﬁcantly related to trust and explained between 6 and
10 % of the observed variance. It turned out that the SNP rs2268498, located in the
promoter of OXTR, is the driving force in both haplotype blocks. In order to prove
the functionality of these genetic variations, we conducted mRNA expression
analyses in hippocampus specimens of pharmaco-therapy resistant temporal lobe
epilepsy patients, from whom we also obtained blood samples for genotyping.
Results showed that carriers of the haplotype that had been associated with high
trust in the laboratory experiment showed a 50 % reduction in OXTR mRNA
expression, as compared to the haplotypes that were related to low trust (Reuter
et al. 2016). In line with the behavioral data, mRNA expression analyses showed
that rs2268498 is the SNP that essentially influences functionality.
    Tabak et al. (2014) used an iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma in order to investigate
behavioral and affective responses following a betrayal of trust. Participants were
told to interact with an anonymous partner. In reality they played with/against a
computer program that initially exhibited a cooperative tit-for-tat strategy and then
began to defect over a series of consecutive trials. The dependent measures were the
time point at which participants started to betray even though the computer was

cooperative, and when they started to retaliate to unfair decisions made by the
computer. Emotional responses to betrayal and retaliation were also assessed. Three
different haplotypes on the OXTR were identiﬁed that were related either to faster
retaliation after betrayal, or with high or low post-betrayal satisfaction, respectively.



4.2.4    Altruism

Many neuroeconomic studies using the dictator game interpret the ﬁrst mover’s
(i.e., the dictator’s) decision as a marker for generosity or altruism. Therefore, the
ﬁndings reported in the above section on the dictator game can also be viewed as
molecular genetic association studies on altruism. However, the question arises of
whether the decision-making in the DG is really altruistic behavior. There exist in
the literature countless deﬁnitions of altruism. One deﬁnition, encompassing many
different facets of the concept, deﬁnes altruism as the selfless concern for the
welfare of others. However, there is a great debate in the literature as to whether
true altruism really exists (Fehr and Fischbacher 2003). Pure altruism is giving
without regard to reward or the beneﬁts of recognition and need. People who doubt
the existence of pure altruism argue that helping others is intrinsically rewarding for
altruistic persons and therefore they are pursuing their personal interest, rather than
the interests of others. In other words helping others makes them feel good, e.g., by
enhancing their self-esteem. This line of argument overcomes the apparent
incompatibility with economic concepts like the homo economicus, postulating that
humans are selﬁsh, rational beings, motivated merely through self-interest (Ng and
Tseng 2008). In order to disentangle genetic and environmental (e.g., upbringing,
education, etc.) influences contributing to the widely acknowledged variability in
altruistic behavior, twin studies are considered the gold standard method. These
behavioral genetic studies mostly rely on self-report data: A twin study by Rushton
et al. (1986) on 563 pairs of monozygous (MZ) and dizygous (DZ) twins using an
altruism scale, reported that 50 % of the variance in altruism was due to genes and
the remaining 50 % due to environmental factors. Noteworthy, the total environ-
mental variance came from nonshared environmental sources (e.g., epigenetic
factors, peer influences, etc.), not from shared ones. A second study by Matthews
et al. (1981) found 72 % heritability for a self-report adjective checklist measure of
empathy in 114 MZ and 116 DZ middle-aged male twins. In an additional twin
study of 322 pairs of twins, Rushton (2004) replicated the strong genetic effects on
prosocial behavior. He reported heritability estimates of 0.40 for females and of
0.50 for males for social responsibility. In contrast to the study from 1986, shared
environmental factors accounted for about 23 % of this variance, whereas in the
previous studies, environmental effects were exclusively due to nonshared envi-
ronmental factors.
    Two independent groups have investigated the role of the DRD4 Exon 3
polymorphism on self-report measures of altruism and arrived at similar results:
Bachner-Melman et al. (2005) observed signiﬁcantly higher altruism scores in
78                                                                M. Reuter and C. Montag

carriers of the 4-repeat allele and Anacker et al. (2013) found signiﬁcantly higher
altruism scores in carriers of the 4/4 genotype. Mertins et al. (2011) used a repeated
public goods game (for a detailed description of the public goods game please see
Chap. 2 in this book by Civai and Hawes) in order to study genetic effects on
altruistic behavior and found evidence for the role of a functional repeat poly-
morphism in the promoter region of the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) gene. In
the public goods game participants have to decide whether to give money to a
community pool or to take their money for themselves, while also proﬁting from the
donations of the other community members. The money in the community pool is
multiplied by the experimenter and shared equally among the community members,
irrespective of whether they have contributed. Noteworthy, the return to the indi-
vidual is always smaller than their original contribution. Therefore, investing in the
community pool is considered an altruistic behavior. In addition, the public goods
game was not conducted as a single shot game, but in a dynamic setting of
increasing information about the other players’ contributions. The ﬁndings show
that male participants carrying the low activity alleles were signiﬁcantly less
altruistic (i.e., gave less money to the community pool) than carriers of the high
activity alleles. Interestingly the genetic effects became smaller with increasing
information about the other players’ behavior in the public goods game. However,
in female participants carrying two low activity alleles of the MAO-A polymor-
phism, the opposite behavior was observed. In females, the low activity alleles were
related to higher altruistic decisions. Gender differences with respect to the MAO-A
promoter repeat polymorphism must be interpreted with caution, given the fact that
the MAO-A gene is located on the X-chromosome. This means that men have only
one allele at the polymorphic region (as they possess only one X-chromosome),
whereas women have a genotype with an allele on each of their two X-chromosomes.
The polymorphism, which is located 1.2 kb upstream of the MAO-A coding
sequences, consists of a 30 bp repeated sequence present in 3, 3.5, 4, or 5 copies.
Functional studies have shown that the 3.5 and 4 copy alleles (i.e., the high activity
alleles) are transcribed 2–10 times more efﬁciently than the 3 or 5 copy alleles (i.e., the
low activity alleles) (Sabol et al. 1998). However, it is not yet proven how strong the
functional impact of the second allele is in women compared to the one allele in men.
At least the location of the MAO-A polymorphism on the X-chromosome could be a
potential explanation for contradictory results based on gender.
    In a laboratory study with N = 101 healthy Caucasian participants, we investi-
gated altruism in a donation experiment (Reuter et al. 2011). Altruism was not
assessed by a classic economic game, but by the amount of money donated to a
poor child in a developing country, after participants earned money through par-
ticipation in two straining computer experiments. The focus was on the dopamin-
ergic system, because dopamine has proven to be—in addition to the prominent
neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin—crucial for prosocial behaviors like
cooperation, attachment style, mentoring, paternal parenting, and positive
4 Genes and Human Decision-Making                                                   79

emotionality, to name but a few (Lucht et al. 2006; Reuter et al. 2006; Shanahan
et al. 2007; Gillath et al. 2008; Walter et al. 2011). The functional Val158Met
polymorphism was signiﬁcantly associated with the size of the donations. Carriers
of at least one Val-allele donated about twice as much money, compared to those
participants without a Val-allele (genotype Met/Met). The functional COMT SNP
together with the personality trait cooperativeness, as assessed by the Temperament
and Character Inventory (TCI; Cloninger et al. 1993), explained about 15 % of the
variance in donation size. The Val-allele, which is characterized by high altruism
and also by high catabolic activity with respect to the degradation of dopamine, is
the ancestral allele at the polymorphic region in codon 158 on the COMT gene.
Today we have equal allele frequencies for the Val- and the Met-allele in Caucasian
populations, indicating that the allele frequency of the Met-allele must have dra-
matically increased over the last 100,000 years. Therefore, it can be concluded that
altruism (as represented by the Val-allele) is less adaptive than selﬁshness (repre-
sented by the absence of the Val-allele; i.e., the presence of the Met/Met genotype).
However, from the perspective of evolutionary psychology, altruism was the pre-
requisite for mankind’s’ success and increases inclusive ﬁtness. Eldakar and Wilson
(2008) contributed an interesting model to this debate. Their model identiﬁes a
strategy called “selﬁsh punisher” that involves behaving selﬁshly in ﬁrst-order
interactions and “altruistically” in second-order interactions by punishing other
selﬁsh individuals. The act of punishing other selﬁsh individuals can be considered
a form of second-order altruism. The idea behind this is that selﬁsh punishers limit
selﬁsh behavior and thereby enable altruists to coexist in a stable equilibrium.
    Strobel et al. (2011) investigated a related construct named altruistic punishment
(for more details, please see Chap. 12 on altruistic punishment by Alexander
Strobel, in this book). Altruistic punishment refers to a behavior in which indi-
viduals punish others for unfair actions (e.g., free-riding, defection, noncoopera-
tion) at a cost to themselves and for the sake of others or the community. According
to this deﬁnition, altruistic punishment indeed meets the criterion for altruism. The
authors conducted a combined fMRI-genetics study. Besides the major ﬁnding that
brain regions related to cognitive and affective functioning (DLPFC, ACC, insula)
were essentially involved in altruistic punishment, they reported an allele load effect
(Met/Met > Val/Met > Val/Val) with respect to the BOLD-response (contrast
punishment vs. nonpunishment) in the cingulate gyrus, the nucleus accumbens and
the insula. Strobel et al. discuss this ﬁnding as suggestive in favor of the hypothesis
that the evolutionarily younger, Met-allele, is favored in societies where reciprocal
behavior—in this case punishment of unfair behavior—is the social norm. Given
that, the Met/Met genotype could be related to less altruism (Reuter et al. 2013), but
in the study by Strobel et al. to more pronounced brain activity during altruistic
punishment, it cannot be taken for granted that altruism and altruistic punishment
are highly correlated, although both constructs represent prosocial behavior. Future
studies should test this hypothesis in a within-subject design.

4.3    Summary and Perspectives

The present chapter on genes and human decision-making gives an overview of
prominent genetic studies that have been published in the ﬁeld of neuroeconomics
to date. It becomes apparent that all studies adopt a candidate gene approach, i.e.,
they derived their hypotheses for testing speciﬁc gene loci from the general liter-
ature on genes and human decision-making. Besides the oxytocin and the vaso-
pressin receptor genes, dopaminergic gene loci have been a particular focus of
interest. Positive associations between these polymorphisms and economic con-
structs like trust, altruism, generosity and reciprocity, support results from quanti-
tative genetic studies (twin studies) demonstrating that human decision-making in
economic contexts is substantially influenced by genetic factors. However, the
explained variance in the phenotypes under investigation is rather small, as is
common in genetic association studies. New techniques in molecular genetics like
genome wide association studies (GWAS; for an overview please see the methods
chapter on genetics in this book), provide the hope of unraveling new gene loci
associated with economic decision-making.
    As outlined in the introduction to this chapter, the genetic approach in neuroe-
conomics offers the possibility of assessing biological variables in ecologically
valid situations. This is a clear advantage over MRI studies, which provide a rather
artiﬁcial—and simultaneously, extreme—laboratory setting. Time will tell whether
interest in this new and promising genetic approach will increase in the ﬁeld of
neuroeconomics.
