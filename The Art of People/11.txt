Today is Honey Day,” announced Brian Murray to the Likeable Media internal Facebook group. “The entire day will be dedicated to appreciating the amazing work that Honey does for us.”

When I read this, I was surprised at first, but then I smiled with glee as I realized what was going on. Likeable Media had been named to the top places to work list by Crain’s for the last three years running. Brian, our director of talent and recruitment, was looking for ways to surprise and delight the staff and decided that one way to do it would be to create a holiday just to recognize one employee—Honey—and make her feel special.

I loved many things about this. I loved how big Brian had gone; before people realized it, there were ribbons and balloons and even a cake in Honey’s honor. I loved how secretive this had been; it had been a surprise not only to Honey but to the entire staff. I loved how it made Honey feel: honored, special, and excited. (I don’t think she’ll ever leave the company. Honestly, would you leave a company that created a holiday in your honor?)

But most of all, I loved how random the whole thing was. Don’t get me wrong: From the little I know, Honey is a terrific employee. But she wasn’t a manager and hadn’t accomplished anything remarkable. That was the whole point, I guess. Just by recognizing someone who worked hard and represented the Likeable core values well, Brian sent a message not only to Honey but to the rest of the team, and to would-be team members, that this was a group that celebrated hard work and loved to surprise and delight.

If you’ve ever been to a casino, you know that one of the first things you notice as you come onto the gambling floor is the sounds of slot machines going off and people winning money. Pretty much any time day or night that you walk into a casino, you’ll hear these sounds. This is not an accident. It’s by design, and it’s based on a powerful psychological principle called variable rewards. The sounds of the slot machines going off remind you that someone is winning right now, and get you thinking at some level, even if not consciously, that you could be the next winner.

When you surprise and delight your employees, your customers, your colleagues, or your family, you’re using the same principle. You probably can’t afford to surprise and delight everyone all the time, but by surprising and delighting some people at random and unexpected times, you get everyone thinking that she could be the recipient of that special something—whether it’s a small cash bonus, a few extra vacation days, or an office holiday named in her honor—the next time.

A few months ago, my wife and I noticed that we had a rare completely free weekend and decided to surprise our daughter, Charlotte. We looked up where her favorite YouTube celebrity, Miranda Sings, was playing that weekend; found decent rates to fly from New York to Knoxville, Tennessee; and told Charlotte that thanks to her good grades and great behavior, we were rewarding her with the weekend in Knoxville. She ended up having an amazing time, even meeting Miranda. Better yet, both she and her sister Kate have been on their best behavior ever since, waiting to be rewarded with the next surprise trip.

I had the honor of meeting Charles Best, the founder and leader of one of my favorite nonprofits, DonorsChoose, which supports teachers and helps them fund classroom projects. When I asked Charles what I could do to help support them, instead of asking for a donation, he handed me a huge stack of fifty-dollar DonorsChoose gift cards. My mission was to hand out the gift cards to my influential friends, introduce them to DonorsChoose.org, and then give them the opportunity to go online and use a free gift card to support their favorite teacher. I thought I surely would be asked to give money when I offered to help but instead was surprised and delighted when I was given the “gift of giving.” In turn, I was able to surprise and delight another fifty people—plus the teachers they would go online to support—and simultaneously got the word out about one of my favorite causes.

But remember, surprise and delight don’t have to cost you money. It’s all about making people feel special and doing things a little differently to accomplish that. Sometimes we’ll start the day with a team-building activity, for instance. Other times we’ll have a surprise happy hour at the end of a hard day’s work. At still other times we might have a spontaneous “moment of rock” to celebrate someone’s accomplishment.

But Brian Murray’s Honey Day was better than anything I’d ever thought of. Over a year later, Honey is one of the most productive employees at the company, and I can’t wait to find out who the next person to get his own holiday will be. Neither can the rest of the company.


FAST First Action Steps to Take:

1. Make a list of five creative ways you can surprise your employees, colleagues, clients, or family.

2. Experiment with creative ways to offer those surprises, and delight your people either directly because of something awesome they’ve done or, better yet, “just because.”

3. Try to surprise and delight people every day, even in little ways: Praise, kind words, and the little things often go as far as the big things.





50. Go Back in Time and Write a Thank You Card (Yes, a Real One)


Wow!” I exclaimed with excitement. I was staring at a thank you card I had received from the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company. I had interviewed Sheldon Yellen, the CEO of the property-restoration company BELFOR, for a previous book, and just a few days later I had gotten the thank you card in the mail.

Truthfully, the thank you card was barely legible (I think Sheldon has about as good handwriting as I have), but it felt incredible nonetheless. The guy was running a huge company, had a family of his own, and had just starred on the CBS television show Undercover Boss, yet he had taken some very precious time out of his day to write a thank you card to me, someone he had never met.

I thought about that card for a while. I thought about the last time I had written thank you cards. It was probably after my wedding nine years earlier! A lot had happened in those nine years. Email had continued to become more and more widespread. Cell phone plans had changed, and now everyone I knew had unlimited text messages. Facebook hadn’t opened up beyond college students at the time of my wedding, and Twitter didn’t exist.

With all the major technological advancements of the last nine years, I realized there were now easier and easier ways to say thank you. You could say thanks with a text, tweet, email, or private message on Facebook or LinkedIn. But I wondered whether a handwritten thank you card would be better received.

I thought about how I felt getting that thank you card from Sheldon Yellen and imagined how I’d have felt if it instead had been a thank you email or text message. It would have felt very different and not nearly as special.

Since I was in the middle of doing research for my book Likeable Business, I decided to ask a few CEOs I was planning to interview already what their experience with giving and receiving thank you cards was. As it turned out, most of the CEOs I talked to said that when they received handwritten thank you cards, they were much more likely to read them than they were when they received emails. I found it fascinating that some of the most successful, busiest people in the world would stop and read a handwritten note sooner than they’d read an email or tweet.

Even more interesting was how many of the people I talked to believed in sending handwritten cards. Besides Sheldon, there was the CEO of Restaurant.com, Cary Chessick; the happiness guru Shawn Achor; and the business leader and Columbia professor Srikumar Rao. All were avid fans of the handwritten thank you note. Most notably, there was Charles Best, whom I interviewed.

Charles Best is the founder and CEO of DonorsChoose, the online nonprofit organization that I mentioned in Chapter 49.

Charles shared with me the results of a study he had conducted to demonstrate the return on investment of gratitude. In that experiment, the DonorsChoose staff sent handwritten thank you notes to half of their recent first-time donors. The other half did not receive thank you notes. The results showed a direct correlation between being thanked by card and the likelihood of giving again. In fact, those who were personally thanked were 38 percent more likely to give another donation, proving an actual ROI of gratitude. Plus, when they gave, they gave more on average.

Though I thought I had been practicing gratitude in our business and in my life by regularly thanking staff and customers by email, an email thank you is just not that special these days. Emails are supereasy to write and send, and although some people may appreciate receiving them, others may resent you for cluttering their in-boxes.

I vowed to begin to write personalized thank you notes. I knew it would be hard to stick to something like this, so I began by writing one card per week on Wednesday and then increased it to three personalized thank you notes each Wednesday. Finally, I increased the quota to three thank you notes each weekday, which I usually would write on the train to work.

The experiment proved powerful very quickly. Some recipients of my notes said they were moved to tears, and others replied by sending nice tweets. But it was clear that everyone appreciated the extra time it took to handwrite a thank you card, seal it, and deliver or send it. In an increasingly digital world, there was something magical about receiving a handwritten note.

My hope and expectation is that thank you cards will help you build loyalty, pride, and, yes, influence among your team members and with your customers, partners, friends, and family. But no matter what, it still feels darn good to write and send them. The amazing thing about gratefulness and unselfishness is this: Whether or not there’s an immediate return on investment in terms of business value, there’s always an immediate result in terms of your happiness.

You will literally feel your mood elevate as you write each thank you card. As we talked about before, that will help put you in a good position to keep the people around you happy. Thus, thank you cards really work doubly to inspire, motivate, and keep the people around you happy.

I know it’s very old-fashioned to advocate for thank you cards as much as I do. But the very fact that it is so old-fashioned and even out of fashion is what makes writing and sending the cards so special. Today, I still begin each day by writing out three or four thank you cards to staff, customers, partners, friends, and family. It’s an essential part of my day and has helped make me a much better leader and human being. And for that, to Sheldon Yellen, Charles Best, and the others who have inspired me, I say, “Thank you!”


FAST First Action Steps to Take:

1. Buy a pack of thank you cards at the local drugstore or stationery store; you can even order personalized ones online. Do it without delay.

2. Write one thank you card the next morning you have an opportunity. Do it as early in the day as you can and hand-deliver it as quickly as possible. The faster the feedback comes, the more inspired you’ll be to keep going.

3. Practice doing this every day until it becomes a habit. Only you know how quickly and profoundly you can make this process habitual, but you will feel happier along the way no matter what.





51. An Intro a Day Goes a Long Way


9/21/13

Dave and Bob, you remind me of each other, so I thought it was about time you met. You’re both bestselling authors, go-givers, entrepreneurs, and immensely likeable guys.

Happy connecting, and shana tova to both of you!

Adam

Adam M. Grant, Ph.D.

Wharton professor and author of Give and Take

www.giveandtake.com



When I received this email in my in-box in September 2013, I was a little surprised. I barely knew the sender, Adam Grant; we’d had one prior conversation, but that was it. I hadn’t asked for an introduction and hadn’t done anything to indicate to Adam that I wanted or needed an introduction to Bob.

As it turned out, though, Adam was right. Bob and I did have a lot in common, and there could be opportunities to collaborate. At the least, it was clear that it might be superhelpful for me to connect with a successful author and speaker such as Bob, whom I definitely had heard of before the intro. I thanked Adam and emailed Bob to connect and then went on with my day.

A few weeks later, I got another email introduction from Adam. At that point I was shocked. Again, I had had one phone conversation with the man but had never met him, helped him, or asked him for anything. I had to figure out what was going on, and so I decided to read Grant’s book, Give and Take.

That book is one of the best books I’ve ever read. With both great stories and tons of research-based data, Grant makes a powerful argument that in business and in life, givers win. Give and Take also introduced me to another Adam, Adam Rifkin.

Adam Rifkin makes three introductions a day. His introductions have led to two marriages, hundreds of jobs, dozens of companies being funded, and at least twelve new business partnerships.

Contrary to what you might think, Rifkin is not a typical people person. In fact, he is a shy introvert who as a successful serial tech entrepreneur doesn’t have a lot of time to network. Yet as Adam told my friend Michael Simmons in an interview for Forbes, “If you already have a network, an introduction is the most powerful daily action you can take to build it. In just a few minutes, you can have a dramatic impact on the lives of two people and generate a large amount of goodwill for yourself and the overall community you’re building.”

At its heart, an introduction does two things. First, it endorses the two people you’re introducing. It tells each of them that the other is worth connecting with. Second, it provides information on why the two people should connect.

If you’ve done an intro well, both parties can benefit. Better yet, you, too, will benefit, as both parties will appreciate you for having thought of them and connecting them. Best yet, it doesn’t take long to make an introduction. This powerful tool is described by Grant as a “five-minute favor.”

It’s nice to make an intro when one party asks you for one, of course, but it’s even more meaningful when you can make a totally unsolicited intro, as Grant did for Bob Berg and me. Think about the people in your network, especially the ones you haven’t spoken with in a while. Think about who might mutually benefit from connecting. Then use LinkedIn or email to make a simple introduction. The one at the start of this chapter is a perfect example. In a concise yet compelling note, tell each person who the other person is. (Better yet, rave about each person to the other.) Then suggest that they connect and hint at why it might be mutually beneficial. This second part is especially important if you’re introducing busy people who may not have a lot of spare time to meet someone new. (Doesn’t that describe us all, though?)

As with writing thank you cards, the hard part is making a system of this practice. Using social media, Rifkin has managed to do just that, as the Forbes article continued: “Adam has marked 50 people as ‘close friends’ on Facebook and set up notifications on Twitter for people he wants to build a deeper relationship with. What this means is that he is more likely to see all of these people’s updates,” which often provides him with a specific reason to reach out to someone (e.g., “I saw that Dave is working on a new book about the art of people. Since Adam is such a master of people skills, I thought you might have some things to talk about”).

“Before these tools existed, you would have to ask people, ‘What’s new?’ Now, you don’t have to do small talk to see where they are. The social networks push it to you.”

He then thinks of relevant, potentially useful introductions for the people in his network and turns to LinkedIn to make them. Since Rifkin joined LinkedIn in December 2003, he has consistently made three introductions per day. That means he has made a mind-boggling ten thousand introductions.

Introductions keep you top of mind with the important people in your network and can have a life-changing impact on the individuals you introduce. And you can do it all in just a few minutes a day.

I’m finally getting together with Bob Berg, the man Adam Grant kindly introduced me to two years ago. I can’t wait to find out what happens next.


FAST First Action Steps to Take:

1. Take an inventory of your network, beginning with LinkedIn and going on to social networks, email, the contacts in your phone, and perhaps even an old-fashioned Rolodex. Write down the names of thirty people you haven’t talked to in a while.

2. Match up each of the thirty names with other people in your network who might mutually benefit from an introduction. Write down these thirty names next to your first thirty.

3. Begin introducing the people in the network whose names you have written down. Start with just one per day no matter how excited you are, so that you don’t burn out too quickly and are more likely to build up endurance in this new exercise. Practice until you develop a habit of making introductions.





52. Buy Him a Bonsai


What the heck can we get a man who has everything?” I asked my chief of staff, Meg. We had just had our first successful meeting with Rich, a venture capitalist in New York, and were trying to think of something nice to send as a thank-you for meeting with us. This was my first time raising money from institutional investors, and I was feeling pretty intimidated by the whole process.

These VCs typically were pitched by at least a hundred people per month. That’s over five pushy entrepreneurs per workday. They were used to saying no to just about everyone who pitched them.

I had begun my practice of handwritten thank you cards by then, but I felt that wouldn’t be enough. Also, at the meeting, I had given him one of my books. I wanted to send something special, something memorable. But like most VCs, this guy Rich was, well, rich. By all accounts, he really had everything he ever needed in terms of material wealth. Well, maybe not a yacht, but since I couldn’t send him that, I was struggling with what kind of thank you gift to send as a follow-up.

“What about a bonsai?” Meg asked totally out of the blue. “A bonsai is special, easy to grow, and lasts a long time.”

As soon as she said that, I knew we had it. A bonsai would be the perfect gift for the venture capitalist who had everything. I asked Meg to look into ordering a bonsai (as we’d obviously never done that before) and began to write out the note that would accompany it:

Dear Rich,

Here’s to your growth, our growth, and the growth of this bonsai. Enjoy.

Best,

Dave Kerpen



I was so excited! A bonsai would be so easy to take care of and would grow for years, just like an investment in our company, Likeable Local. We ordered the bonsai and sent it with my note for two-day delivery and waited with anticipation for Rich to receive it.

Unfortunately, we got a response from Rich before he had received the bonsai. Rich had chosen to pass on investing in Likeable Local. He said by email that he “liked the business a lot. But I’m just not so sure whether it will scale.”

I was devastated. Honestly, of course, I was upset about getting rejected by a VC, but after having worked so hard to find the perfect thank you gift for someone who didn’t need anything, I was even more upset that I had been rejected before the gift arrived.

Luckily, Meg, my supertalented chief of staff who’s always there for me, was there again.

“Dave, first of all, I’m sure he’ll reply again after he gets the bonsai. Second of all, you never know what the future will bring,” she said. “And third, perhaps most important, no matter what happens here, I think we’re onto something!”

Meg was right.

The next day, Rich replied again with a thank-you for the bonsai. He wrote: “Thanks much for the thoughtful bonsai, Dave! I love it. Let’s hope I can take better care of it than I did for your company.”

Considering that Rich had just rejected me, his joke wasn’t very reassuring. However, I received another email the next day: “Hey Dave. I want to introduce you to Tim, a fellow VC who’s more bullish on SMB-focused businesses than I am. Tim, Dave is a great, thoughtful entrepreneur. You two should definitely connect.”

The point is that for those people you want to keep happy and influence positively, it is generally worth it to purchase and send a thoughtful gift. A bonsai is the perfect gift for venture capitalists and other investors because it grows, as they want their investments to do, and because it’s thoughtful and even classy without being too expensive. (We buy them now in bulk for about $35 each.) If wealthy venture capitalists appreciate a $35 bonsai, surely so will anyone else in your life.

Of course, most people will appreciate any type of thoughtful gift; it doesn’t have to be a bonsai. In addition to bonsais, books, and thank you cards, we’ve sent trophies, bottles of wine, mini herb gardens, chocolates, and lots of giant foam thumbs. We even sent a toy moat to one investor who said we needed to build a better moat to protect our business before he’d invest.

They say it’s the thought that counts, but to me, when it comes to giving memorable thank-yous, it’s both the thought and the execution that count. It’s all about thinking outside the box and sending something that nobody else would send and that will make the recipient smile.

As for the connection Rich made to Tim? It took a while, but Tim eventually wrote me a nice check to invest in our company. He got a really nice bonsai the next day.


FAST First Action Steps to Take:

1. Write down the names of five important people in your career and/or life whom you’d really like to keep happy.

2. For each of those five people, brainstorm a thoughtful, affordable thank you gift that nobody else would send and that will make the recipient smile. (It’s okay to go with a bonsai if you can’t think of anything else.)

3. Start a thank you gift closet. Purchase a stockpile of creative thank you gifts and then send them out regularly, not on special occasions, ideally with handwritten notes.





53. Be Unoriginal, Part 2: How to Remain Top of Mind for Thousands of People Every Day


If you build it, they won’t come, Dave.”

Those words, spoken by my wife and business partner, Carrie, stuck like a knife in me. For one thing, my favorite movie was Field of Dreams, and so when she riffed off of its most famous line in a negative way, it wasn’t easy to listen to.

Another reason it stung is that I realized that as usual, Carrie was right. It was 2008, and we were talking about the new social media–driven Web that was quickly emerging at that time. What Carrie was so poetically saying was that the days of building a website and then expecting people to surf the Web and simply find it were quickly ending. In fact, fewer and fewer people were even using the expression “surf the Web.” Instead, it seemed, the Web was surfing people through the reliable waves that were Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

Fortunately, I agreed with Carrie. We brainstormed what to do about this problem and realized that instead of building beautiful websites and destinations for companies, we could build beautiful and valuable content and then help companies get people’s attention by distributing it where people were spending their time: on the social networks.

“If we build it, we can come to them,” we reasoned. The strategy worked, and we were able to base two successful companies on this notion.

During that process, we began working on our personal brands as well. We realized that if social media could help grow brands and small businesses, we could do the same thing for ourselves. The field of personal branding has exploded in the last few years, and today many people see the value of using social media to get a better job, find new customers or partners, or land a better book deal, to name a few outcomes.

But back in 2008 we felt like pioneers. The strategy was the same one we used for our businesses: Build it and then come to people. In other words, build social media accounts and then create, curate, and share great, valuable content on a regular basis. When I lived in Boston, my favorite sports radio station was WEEI. I took those letters and applied them to content across social media: Entertain people. Educate people. Inspire people (EEI).

The strategy worked, and we each gained many thousands of followers across Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. One thing was for sure: We helped demonstrate that good content alone can rise to the top. At one point, I had more page views (20 million–plus) on LinkedIn than Bill Gates, Jack Welch, and Mark Cuban combined. It certainly wasn’t because of intelligence, wealth, or success; it was because I shared more and arguably better content than those guys did.

But it has gotten noisier and noisier in social media as more and more brands, small businesses, and individuals have begun to create more and more content in an effort to come to consumers. The result is what my author friend Mark Schaefer calls “content shock.” There’s just too much content and not enough time for people to get through it all.

The good news is that instead of having to become a content factory, constantly churning out endless amounts of entertaining, educational, and inspiring content to feed the beast of social media, you can become a great curator. The content is already out there; all you have to do is find the EEI content that best resonates with you and that you think will resonate with your own network, and be the one who shares it.

I’m going to let you in on a little secret about social media: Few people pay attention to who created great content, but everyone remembers whom they got it from. Of course, you should always quote the sources of your content. Also, there’s nothing wrong with creating your own original blog posts, tweets, and LinkedIn updates; it’s just very time-consuming.

It is much easier to be the best curator, to find great sources and queue up most of your content in advance. The social networks you should be doing this for depend on your goals, but for most people, LinkedIn and Twitter are great places to start. (Facebook is good, too, but is more personal and private than the other two.) There are lots of free tools available to help you curate and schedule great content (Likeable Hub from our company is one such free tool).

By scheduling lots of great content for social media, you’ll end up literally at the top of people’s news feeds and therefore at the top of their minds. Just about every day someone in my network says something to the effect of “I see you everywhere! Love your content, keep it up.” Meanwhile, a lot of “my” content is actually other people’s: valuable educational articles and how-to guides I find, entertaining videos and infographics I find, and inspirational quotes and stories I find. EEI. Not my own, but carefully curated to my audiences.

The best part about social media is how well it scales. One good article can be shared, seen, and appreciated by hundreds or even thousands of people. Think about the old days and how great salespeople and small-business owners stayed top of mind through written and mailed letters or newspaper or radio ads. Now the same letter that used to reach a single person can reach thousands or tens of thousands or even millions without any more cost or effort.

Of course, you also can use technological tools to reach people privately and stay top of mind in a more personal, intimate way. Whereas LinkedIn and Twitter are great tools for mass branding, Snapchat, WhatsApp, and texting are excellent tools for building relationships one at a time. Sometimes people appreciate getting an article, tip, idea, or quote directly from you in a private forum rather than seeing it as a public share with the world. If you meet someone important you want to influence, get her contact info and without being pushy and never asking for anything send her a private message sharing content you think she’ll find particularly valuable.

I tweeted at Shark Tank star and serial entrepreneur and investor Lori Greiner about a year ago one night when I saw her promoting her book during an episode of the show. But instead of a public tweet I sent her a direct, private message saying I’d be happy to help her promote her book. I was surprised and excited when she replied with her cell phone number.

Within a week and before we even had a phone call, Lori and I were texting each other furiously, and contrary to the popular belief that electronic communication lacks intimacy, we were building up way more intimate a relationship than we could have done with a call or perhaps even with a meeting. I texted her several articles on how to launch a bestselling book, only one of which I had written, and she appreciated it. She ended up with an Amazon bestseller a few weeks later, and I ended up with a new friend. A year later, Lori was there for me when I needed a favor or two. And we’ve still never met face-to-face!

Keeping people happy is not an easy task. Keeping a large following happy is even harder. However, you don’t have to be an original-content machine to be top of mind for people while building your personal brand. You just have to know where to find that content and how to become the best curator in your network.


FAST First Action Steps to Take:

1. If you’re not already on LinkedIn or Twitter, join one of those key social networks for building your personal brand. If you’re already on one network, join the other.

2. Spend thirty minutes looking for educational, entertaining, and inspiring (EEI) content. Keep a master list and begin to share and schedule the content for your social networks.

3. Find content appropriate for five key individuals in your network and send it to them privately through Snapchat or WhatsApp or in a text message.

4. Make a habit of finding and sharing EEI content on a regular basis. At a minimum, you can do this by scheduling thirty minutes a week for the process of curation.





Conclusion


Getting Everything You Want in Life Is All About People and the Ultimate Paradox


I’ve gotten some really great advice from some terrific people over the years. I’ve been fortunate to meet world-class business leaders, authors, and mentors. But probably the most compelling piece of advice I’ve ever heard was from my wife, Carrie, who turned to me one day while we were sitting on the couch. The moment couldn’t have been more random; it was just a normal Saturday afternoon on a cool, crisp autumn day. The kids were upstairs playing, and neither of us was talking business. We had just finished lunch, and we were having a rare totally relaxing moment on the couch, when Carrie turned to me and said:

“You know, the ultimate paradox is that the secret to getting everything you want at work and in life is treating people well, not trying to get everything you want. Meet the right people, listen well, connect and inspire them, and they’ll want to give you everything that you want. They’ll want to do this so badly, you won’t even need to ask!”

“You’re a genius,” I replied. And she was dead right.

The days of forcing or bullying your way to the top are over. The loudest, most aggressive, most assertive people are no longer the winners in business and in life. The needy, whiny, pushy people might have been successful in the past and might even be successful in the short term today, but they won’t be the winners in the future. Instead, the winners will be the people who know how to understand themselves and connect with and work well with others.

We’ve spent a lot of time together talking about how to understand yourself and others better, how to listen better, how to connect on a deeper level, and how to influence people. We’ve also discussed the conflicts and challenges that may emerge.

We’ve talked about how to teach people, inspire people, and keep the people around you happy at work, at home, and in your entire network.

Although these methods won’t lead to instant success, they will position you to be the person whom people want to be around, the person whom people know, like, and trust—and yes, the person people want to help succeed.

Follow The Art of People playbook and people will want to help you get everything you want at work and in life.

This may be the end of the book, but it’s the beginning of our journey together. As I urged you in the Introduction, I will urge you again: Connect with me as early and as much as you’d like. I want more than anything to help you succeed in mastering the people skills you’ve learned in these pages. So tweet me, LinkedIn with me, email me if you’d like. You can even schedule a free one-to-one video chat with me at ScheduleDave.com. I’m looking forward to seeing you grow and succeed.



The Art of People is just that—it’s an art and not always a science. But if you’ve read this far and especially if you’ve done the FAST action steps at the end of every chapter, you’ve already begun to master the art of people. Here’s to your continued success!





Acknowledgments
