CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
After Games, What?
THE somber picture presented in Parts I and II of this book, in which human life is mainly a
process of filling in time until the arrival of death, or Santa Claus, with very little choice, if any, of
what kind of business one is going to transact during the long wait, is a commonplace but not the
final answer. For certain fortunate people there is something which transcends all classifications of
behavior, and that is awareness; something which rises above the programming of the past, and that
is spontaneity; and something that is more rewarding than games, and that is intimacy. But all three
of these may be frightening and even perilous to the unprepared. Perhaps they are better off as they
are, seeking their solutions in popular techniques of social action, such as "togetherness." This may
mean that there is no hope for the human race, but there is hope for individual members of it.
