CHAPTER 8

Tactics and Values

“Experience is not what happens to you; it’s what you do with what
happens to you.”
Aldous Huxley
The decisions you take and the way you behave during your negotiations
will be inﬂuenced by how much power you think you have and by the way
your own values or ethics inﬂuence your behavior.
The tactics you employ will be limited by both how much power you
have, whether you have a short- or long-term relationship to consider and
this may inﬂuence how ethical you choose to be during your negotiations.
The dilemma of where the value of fairness ﬁts into negotiation has
challenged many organizations. For instance, some organizations who
hold strong views on being fair and reasonable may take exception when
faced with a trading partner who behaves in a manipulative or irrational
manner. On principle, they will not tolerate the behavior and will exit the
relationship.
RECOGNIZING THE PROCESS AND THE GAMESMANSHIP IN PLAY

The way the balance of power is split, and how it shifts with time and
circumstance, means you cannot expect agreements always to be, or
appear to be, balanced and fair, or even consistent. You can, however,
work towards getting the best possible deal given the circumstances you
face. Some, faced with such situations, turn to tactics and some become

144

THE NEGOTIATION BOOK

victims of the tactics in play. The Complete Skilled Negotiator sees them
for what they are and where necessary uses counter tactics to neutralize
their eﬀects.
I am not implying here what is right or wrong. You will conduct business
based on values that are probably diﬀerent from those of others. This does
not make yours right or wrong; it does not make the other party’s values
right or wrong. It simply means that our interpretation, understanding,
and use of tactics will diﬀer from others as the implications of making
use of them will diﬀer based on your circumstances and our view of what
acceptable behavior is made up of.
As a general rule, negotiations that focus on short-term agreements with
parties with whom we have no ongoing relationship, or prospect of one in
the future, are more inclined to gravitate towards value distribution (1–6
o’clock) negotiations. Tactics tend to be more readily used in these styles of
negotiations as the relationships involved tend not to be long term.
A QUESTION OF CHOICES AND PERSONAL STYLE

The concept of “fairness” is exploited by some negotiators through the use
of tactics. Western democratic societies are designed to oﬀer freedom and
choice. This serves to remove the notion of being controlled, and, as long as
we have choices, many perceive this as freedom and fairness. So choices are
designed to signal fairness. However, if like governments you are controlling
the options or choices, then you have the power to inﬂuence the outcome.
However, if you are overtly unfair in the choices you provide others,
trust will be diﬃcult to build and, with no trust, it is diﬃcult to negotiate
collaboratively (7–12 o’clock on the clock face).
Social laws, or the unwritten laws of society, inﬂuence our view of what
is fair and reasonable under whatever circumstances. Business partnerships, where there is a need to maintain productive relationships and the
need to jointly problem solve or develop incremental value by working
together, require at least some level of trust.
To be perceived to be fair in business, you need to oﬀer choices: choices
that are not so one-sided that they quickly become regarded transparent
and unfair.

TACTICS AND VALUES

145

Personal attributes

Your personal values and how they inﬂuence your behavior will have a
powerful bearing on where you and the other party gravitate to on the
clock face. They can, if not managed, directly inﬂuence whether you build
relationships or whether you enter into combat each time you seek to
agree terms. Below are some of the personal attributes to consider and the
inﬂuence they will exert during your negotiations.
Trust in business has to be earned and is easily broken. It implies
that you are good for your word. If you say something will happen, it
happens, consistently. You approach the conversation from their perspective, sharing their concerns and working on the problems that you
both identify, together. It does not mean that you have to pay by conceding on terms, by oﬀering personal favors or by being more transparent
with your interests.
Respect comes from being ﬁrm, consistent and reliable. If you are too
ﬂexible or concede too easily, the other party will regard you as being
weak. In negotiation, everything is possible, but diﬃcult. The fact that
it is diﬃcult ensures that the work you put into the deal, engineering the
terms, and moving reluctantly, attracts respect for you, your position and
your credibility.
Integrityy comes from consistency. This can present issues for negotiators who are too focused on not being unpredictable. Maintaining
conﬁdentiality and being reliable, in that you follow through with your
commitments, also help promote integrity, which in some relationships
or even industries is critical if business is to take place at all.
Honestyy. You never need to lie in negotiation. You don’t need to tell
them what you won’t do. Focus on what you will do. Think “how” or
“on what basis could we, or could they?” By telling them what you are
prepared to do you are at least maintaining honesty. By telling them you
are prepared to pay $100 when you know that you could pay $150 is not
lying. Don’t confuse the process of negotiation with lying and telling the
truth. If you lie in negotiation, you could be taking unnecessary risks,
and in some cases completely compromising relationships, however, don’t
expect everyone to adhere to this discipline.

146

THE NEGOTIATION BOOK

Consideration of the needs of the other party. If you don’t understand
these you are not ready to negotiate. Your planning, preparation, research,
and exploration meetings are all there to help you to establish their position, motives, priorities, and interests. To place a value on these you have
to understand the deal the way they do business from inside their head.
Considering the facts will allow you to remain sensitive to the issues and
respectful where necessary.
Empathyy is about understanding and appreciating the challenges from
their perspective, but never compromising because of such understandings.
Responsibility. It is you who will conduct your negotiations and you
who will make the decisions with the authority limits you have been
given. The more trust that genuinely exists within your relationships,
the more scope you have to open up the agenda and work together creatively. This will only come about if you cultivate the necessary climate
and discussions.
Risky attributes

Openness. This can be dangerous in negotiation. Information is power
and the more you share with the other party, the more you will expose
yourself. Be open but stay within the parameters that you set yourself.
If you don’t understand this from the outset you will place yourself in a
very vulnerable position.
Compassion. In the tough world of business your job is to maximize
opportunity. You will do this with those you can work with and rely on,
and who remain highly competitive. This is a capitalist market we operate
in. Compassion, like generosity, has to take a back seat once a negotiation
commences unless of course you have a longer-term plan in mind.
WHAT ARE TACTICS?
When do tactics usually come into play?

Tactics tend to be used more frequently when one party has more power than
the other and tries to take advantage of it. Tactics are also more frequently

TACTICS AND VALUES

147

used where the nature of the negotiation is based on value distribution and
the focus is on taking as much value oﬀ the table as possible.
Dealing with tactics and when to use them

There are dozens of books written on negotiation that present tactics
as the basis of negotiation. They are given names that serve to explain
the approach: “The Russian front,” “ The Trojan horse,” and so on. The
most important thing about tactics is to recognize them for what they
are.
•
•

They are neither clever nor sophisticated.
They are designed to apply pressure and usually by those who can
because they have enough power, or think they have enough power, to
do so, or those who think they are clever enough to do so without any
consequences.

However, they are used with such regularity that one has to recognize
and understand them, adapt to them, and, where necessary and appropriate, even use them. To help with this I have categorized a range
of tactics using a simple scale of 1–10 (1 is low and 10 is high) against
two factors:
•
•

Power required: the amount of power you will need to have or be
perceived to have relative to the other party for this tactic to work.
Relationship erosion: the degree to which your relationship or any
trust that may exist within it will be eroded, if the tactic once used
becomes obvious or transparent to the other party.

1. Information

Information is power. The more information you have about the options, circumstances, and priorities of the other party, the more powerful you become.

“What if . . . ” and “Suppose that . . . ” questions used during the
exploratory and closing stages can help you to work out the degree of
ﬂexibility the other party is prepared to oﬀer, or the relative value of
the issues being discussed.
For example: “What if we were to ‘hypothetically’ increase the order
after 3 months, how might that change the fee structure?” There may be
no intention of doing so, but the idea is to test assumptions, gain insights
and untimately trade more eﬀectively later on during your negotiation. It
can be used to explore possibilities, especially where deadlock is looming.

This is where one party asks the other for a view, a comment, or to simply share an insight, in the name of helping both parties make progress.
Their intentions may be genuine, but the information is sought for one
reason only: to get inside your head. You may choose to use it yourself
for the same reason. However, when asked for an “oﬀ the record” meeting, always remember the real risks you carry. Any indications, signals,
comments, or even attitudes you imply will be read into. There is no
such thing as an “oﬀ the record” meeting. Anything you tell them or their
business will quickly make its way to the decision maker and is likely to
inﬂuence the outcome. By all means make use of “oﬀ the record,” but do
not get used by it.
Full disclosure and openness

When a request for full disclosure is made before or during a meeting, there needs to be a reasonable degree of trust or mutual dependency
before parties tend to agree. Even then it usually comes with conditions
or limits: “We will share our data with you on the current site, but feel
that extending this to our overall operation to be unnecessary,” is the type
of response you will get. Some will say: “I’m going to be really open with
you,” which usually means they are not. This is also the case when people
use such words as “really,” “actually,” “genuinely,” “seriously,” “sincerely,” and,
most common of all, “honestly.” Whenever I have heard these words in
negotiation where people are under pressure, I have concluded that the
truth has not been in play. Listen out for them and remain mindful of the
longer-term implications of full disclosure.

TACTICS AND VALUES

151

In reality, you can assume that something will usually be held back.
The process of due diligence is used for very good reasons: to ensure the
integrity of information provided is true and complete.
Why?

10

This simple question can be used to challenge everything from interests,
priorities, agenda items or even new proposals. It has been used as an
eﬀective way of establishing the thinking and importance of any issue or
statement. Anyone can ask “why?”, which is why curious children ask it
time after time in their quest for knowledge. The information you receive
will always provide an insight, even if it’s something like: “We are not
prepared to go into detail on that issue.” During exploration discussions,
it’s worth asking why the other party is asking the very question that they
are; and what insight this gives you into their thinking.
2. Time and momentum

Time is the most powerful lever available to any negotiator. Time and
circumstances aﬀect the value of just about every product or service
bought and sold around the world. If I was going to provide you with a
full advertising plan to support your June election campaign, but could
not actually start until June, my services would be deemed useless and
without value. However, if the service could commence in during March,
and run for 3 months peaking with tailored activity throughout June, the
service could attract a premium. It’s the same service with a diﬀerent time
slot, which makes all the diﬀerence. So, understanding the time pressures
of the other party is vital to you being able to optimize the leverage during
your negotiations. How you communicate your own time pressures or use
the other party’s time pressures to gain movement or agreement can be
directly inﬂuenced by the tactics you use.

152

Deadlines

“If you do not agree by Friday we will not be able to start the project in
the timescales you have stipulated.”
“We are closing the book on this one so we will need to know by this
afternoon if you want to take part.”
“If we can agree in principle today, I will ensure you get the business,
subject to us ‘ironing out’ the terms.”
The pressure that deadlines can exert means that some may not only
use this tactic as a closing device, but also to provide you with the feeling
of having “won.” Deadlines are used in many other ways, for example:
“Because of changes in our business, after today’s deadline, any agreement
will have to be signed oﬀ by my boss.” On some occasions, once the other
party has established your deadlines they will employ this need as a trading variable. They will imply that the timing issue is not so critical to them.
Be careful when providing total transparency relating to the implications
of deadlines; it can be a highly eﬀective and manipulative tool.
“And just one more thing”
0

This is often used at the end of the negotiation when the deal is
regarded as all but done. One party turns to the other just as you are
about to shake hands and says: “Just one more thing, you will of course
be including the flexible payment scheduling we discussed earlier?”
They pause and wait with their hand held out. You think, I’m there,
deal done, finished, closed. Do I now open up the discussion again,
or worse still, compromise the agreement by saying “no, but I didn’t
think that flexible payment scheduling was ever part of the terms we
had agreed.”

TACTICS AND VALUES

153

As you can see, this tactic has a higher relationship erosion factor. If
the other party has either power or enough nerve, they will and should
challenge the assumption by attaching a condition to the ﬂexible payment
scheduling in the same way they would have if it had been raised earlier
during the formal discussions.
Denied access

10

When you need to move discussions on, perhaps due to time pressure
or the implications of deadlines, some will use denied access as a tactic.
They simply ensure they are not available. They tell their colleagues and
assistants to pass on the message they are in back-to-back meetings, out
of town, away, or anything that ensures that you, the other party, cannot
make progress until they are ready.
One way of dealing with this situation when you are conﬁdent that
denied access is in play is to leave a message for the other party, bringing
your deadline artiﬁcially forward, adding that if the deadline passes without
agreement, the deal is oﬀ or the terms on oﬀer are time limited. Although
risky, this buys you a window of opportunity between the deadline they
think you are working to and the one actually in play. Another is to introduce
a credible option, perhaps another party or option that you plan to take up
and you need to let them know within certain timescales. If you don’t hear
back you will place the order, reluctantly, elsewhere. Of course these options
carry risks but often work as a way of unlocking the denied access tactic.

or deadlines, stating that their oﬀer expires on a certain date. Further

154

THE NEGOTIATION BOOK

demands are then introduced as a consequence of the deadline not being
met as “compensation” against the implications.
Time constraints are also used where one party is near agreement on most
of the terms, but the other decides to hold out for a better fee rate. They say:
“We will give you one last chance to increase your oﬀer. Please advise us by
5.30 pm on Friday of what this is, and we'll let you know if we are prepared to
progress.” During the time that passes, which is aimed at fuelling uncertainty
and doubt, the other party is often pressured into improving their ﬁnal oﬀer.
The auction

The bidding process is designed to create competition. The process is
engineered and controlled by the organizers. As the bids increase, rational
judgment is tested and for those with high egos, winning has been known
to take over as the predominant driver of behavior. Time and momentum
work against those willing to continue bidding, so a clear and absolute
break point must feature as part of your planning if you are to enter such
a process.
Time out

When in doubt, for whatever reason, adjourn the meeting and take a
time out to regroup. You need to understand the implications, risks, or
ﬁnances if you are to maintain clarity and be able to work out how you are
going to move forward. It is often used when new information comes to
the fore, or if deadlock is looming and a need for a “fresh look” at the deal
is needed. It’s also used when time is running out and one party chooses
to put the other under pressure by removing themselves from the room
until time pressures become critical.

3. Fear or guilt

This next category raises the stakes in the relationship and heightens the
risk. With high levels of power, threats are used in subtle ways to create
movement. It is the fear of these threats or the fear of losing the deal that
is played upon by those seeking to manipulate the power they have.

This is made up of a variety of non-violent but yet physical gestures
which are introduced to unsettle and distract you. This can include leaning across the table to invade your personal space, sitting very close to
you, or changing the seating pattern, so they are sat next to you. Seating
positioned to face the sunlight or groups crammed into very small rooms
are all part of the environment used to intimidate. Always remember that
you are in charge and that includes your environment, so if it does not
feel right, challenge it, question it and change it. You’ll attract respect for
doing so and set the scene for equal respect in the meeting.

This is typically used in team negotiations where one member of
the team makes very high or irrational demands, and the other oﬀers a
more reasonable approach; or one is challenging and dismissive whilst
their colleague presents themselves as far more understanding. The approach is designed to make the “good guys” appear reasonable, rational,
and understanding, and therefore all the more agreeable. Essentially it’s
using the law of relativity to attract cooperation. It’s transparent enough
and certainly erodes any potential for trust, so ensure next time you are
exposed to it that you see it for what it is.

As described by Gavin Kennedy in his book Everything is Negotiable, this
tactic is taken from the Second World War where a Russian lieutenant
was told by his colonel that he would be sent to the Russian front unless
he did as asked. The colonel had the power, the lieutenant believed it was
for real, and the result was predictable. He would do whatever was asked
willingly, rather than being sent to the Russian front. In negotiation, it is
referred to when providing two options. This is based on getting the other
party to accept the better of two evils. One you know will prove challenging and the other an outright disaster. If the whole concept is not rejected,
the chances are you will be seduced into agreeing to the challenging one.

This tactic attempts to make the position or request “personal” and works
most eﬀectively in familiar relationships: “You can do this for old times’
sake,” or “If you do this for me I will ensure your proposal is accepted,” or
“You scratch my back and I’ll scratch yours.” It leans on a sense of obligation
to the point where it’s aimed at leaving you feeling embarrassed if you do
not yield. You must remain ﬁrm, point out the compromising position this
would leave you in and explain that it’s not personal, just business.

a commitment has not been met or a performance not as it should be.
This tactic is used to full eﬀect where one party is negotiating compensation to include inconvenience, loss of face, indirect loss of earnings, even
future risk; this results in a demand way beyond the normal ﬁnancial
obligations.

The social smell is used to imply that you are the odd one out. It’s
designed to make you question your own judgment: “If everyone else
is behaving in a certain way (agreeing), why am I not?” It comes in
the form of a statement about what “others are doing” and importantly
what you are not. It implies that you are out of sync, the odd one out,
and that you are missing out or even being irrational. “Everyone else
has committed … you’ll be the only one not included so you are likely
to miss out whilst your competitors have all agreed.” The idea is that
it helps apply pressure to conform, highlights isolation, and promotes
self-doubt.
Silence

As a powerful tactic, silence is used to unnerve the other party. It can
result in a waiting game because the ﬁrst to talk is likely to be the ﬁrst to
concede. For many, the discomfort alone of continued silence can result in
a concession or oﬀer of further ﬂexibility. And yet for the experienced negotiator it may be that they simply need time to think through their next
move. Silence is best used directly after you have stated your proposal or
after they have stated theirs. Just wait. Even if they respond, wait further.
The pressure builds and often leads to more concessions.

4. Anchoring

This is where one party sets out to form an anchor (an opening position
taken up by one party from which they will move but such movement
will come at a price). The aim of anchoring is to adjust the expectations of
the other party providing an extreme and yet realistic opening position.
Movement becomes relative to the anchor. If you open with your position
ﬁrst and are able to get the other party talking about it, even if this means
them rejecting it, it is your position that becomes anchored in their mind.
Unless they make a counter-oﬀer. Often they become so preoccupied
with attacking your position, they forget all about their own position.

Opening statements are designed to manage the aspirations of the other

The idea is to test an assumed position of power by eﬀectively telling them
that, whilst you are in a position of “indiﬀerence,” they are under pressure
to conclude the deal with you: “I understand that you need an agreement
in place by the end of the day,” or “I want to make it clear that today’s
discussions are to ensure that we have given you every opportunity to win

assumed authority designed to get the other party talking and thinking
about how they are going to move towards you.

This is an extension to the power statement where you start the

current performance levels and clearly no desire to oﬀer compensation,
terminating the contract is the only option for us.” Or, “This may only be
a small order, but failure to agree could aﬀect all of your business with
us.” The devastating consequences of non-cooperation can shock the
other party into reconsidering their position or backtracking from the
outset, where saving the relationship becomes their primary objective.

This is a shock reaction to their opening position. Both physically
whether by extreme facial reaction and/or verbally, you are demonstrating
your shock and surprise at their position. Used regardless of their opening

eﬀect of undermining their conﬁdence in their position and expectations.

the discussion will revolve around their position. They start to sound
like a broken record but the message gets through. Of course this can
be interpreted as intransigence and can result in you losing patience and
concluding the meeting. They will require a moderate amount of power
of around 4/10 to be able to carry it oﬀ.
5. Empowerment

This involves the degree to which you are authorized to trade (see also
Chapter 7), and the extent to which others need to be involved in the

are authorized to go to, so that they can complete the deal today, rather
than risk the deal being jeopardized, or so as not to allow your boss to
see the other concessions that you have already oﬀered. It’s also used to
disassociate yourself from not being able to accept a proposal: “That’s out
of my control and I will need to come back to you on that one.”

This is where several layers of decision-making authority allow for further conditions to be applied each time the agreement is referred. Typically
it’s where your supplier or customer states that they will take the deal for
sign-oﬀ to their boss. A day later, the call comes that, subject to one ﬁnal

TACTICS AND VALUES

161

concession, the deal will be agreed. You reluctantly agree. A day later, they
call and state that their boss has signed it oﬀ and it’s now been sent for
approval to the board and that if you could just agree to the 30-day payment
terms it will gain agreement. Reluctantly you agree and ask if they will let
you know when it has been approved. The next day they calls to again advise
you that the board have now signed it oﬀ and they have now handed it over

small concession that will be necessary if “ﬁnal” sign-oﬀ is to be achieved.
You should always understand the decision-making levels and process,
otherwise you leave yourself exposed to defense in depth.

This is used where one party disempowers themselves, saying that they
cannot or are not allowed to change the terms. They refer to their own
company policy, legal requirements, association requirements, or even
historical precedents and, although sometimes true, it’s often a tactic in
play used to legitimize their position. “Our company policy is 60 days
payment on all transactions and there is nothing we can do about that.”
It’s frequently used to provide rationale in an attempt to bolster the credibility of their proposal. Ensure you insist that such constraints are their
problem and that you welcome suggestions on how they plan to work
around them in order to avoid you having to escalate the issue.

This is used to suggest that budgets are ﬁnite, the speciﬁcation is ﬁxed,

or leave it.” It’s designed to place the onus of obligation on the other party,
implying that they need to work within that which you can aﬀord. In
contrast, when faced with such tactics the receiving party can change the
speciﬁcation, the volume, the timing, or any variable that helps to naturalize the implications of the ﬁxed fee.

Transferring the obligation for solutions or ideas onto the other party,
to make it their problem. “We have a problem in making our payment on
time this month. We can make the transfer but it is going to be 5 days
late, how do you want to deal with this?” Once they have been advised,
the problem becomes a shared one. The implications may still sit squarely
with you but you have transferred the onus onto the other party.

This is where issues are positioned as oﬀ-limits (non-negotiable or “oﬀ
the agenda” for the purpose of these discussions). They are often described
as “things I can’t agree, so let’s focus on the terms we can agree today.”
Remember, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Their motive is
to protect some of the more critical issues from negotiation. This can also
result in a negotiation over what is negotiable before the real negotiation
even begins. This tactic is commonly used in political negotiations but
regularly features in all types of commercial settlement negotiations too.

TACTICS AND VALUES

163

When a new person takes over the relationship or a new account manager
is introduced, both past precedents and history carry far less relevance.
New faces need not be tied to or constrained by what has happened in the
past. They can sometimes oﬀer a solution to deadlock where personalities
stand in the way of progress. They can provide for a fresh examination of
aﬀairs or can even be used to intimidate the other party where the seniority of the new negotiator carries certain gravitas. Retailers are renowned
for changing their buyers systematically and periodically so that new faces
remove the familiarity of an existing trading relationship. This keeps the
focus on terms fresh and removes any scope for complacency.
6. Moving the costs around

This category comes from reconﬁguring the package or speciﬁcation, or
manipulating the terms in order to provide a diﬀerent complexion to the
deal. The relationship between speciﬁcation and price is used by many
tactical negotiators as a means of manipulating the cost of supply, whilst
attracting the best possible price.
The building block technique

This is where one party requests a price but only for part of their actual
requirements. You then request prices for various quantity arrangements,
ranging up to and including your actual needs. The idea is to manage
expectations in the ﬁrst instance and understand the relative cost/price
diﬀerences and implications across the diﬀerent arrangements. This
can reveal much about their cost base and margin structure. You then
negotiate for a 1-year agreement, for example, in the knowledge that you
can raise this to a 3-year agreement. You then seek incentives from the
other party in the event that you could extend the agreement to 2 years,
and then negotiate incremental terms for this “doubling” of the contract.

164

THE NEGOTIATION BOOK

Finally, you broaden the discussion to a 3-year partnership. Of course, to
agree to such a deal, you will require more preferential terms.
The building block technique involves planning out your stages, which
can apply to any variable and provides time for the other party to adjust
to concessions that would otherwise be diﬃcult to extract.

Each time they make a proposal, you say “yes, subject to our terms.”
Your terms turn out to be either equally as outrageous, or are ﬁnancially
designed to oﬀset the implications of agreeing to them. One party says:
“Your discount levels based on last year’s performance are being adjusted
from 10% to 7.5% for the year ahead.” And the other party responds:
“Subject to you improving your promotional funding from $100,000 to
$250,000 for the year, we will accept the reduction in discount.”
The response from the ﬁrst party will inevitably be: “We can’t do that” to
which you suggest: “and that’s why we are not in a position to accept your
position.” You rarely need say no in a negotiation. Just ﬁnd a way, a basis,
a set of conditions upon which the consequences, be they ﬁnancial, risk,
or third-party implications, are neutralized by the terms you attach to it.

Everything is conditional and therefore linked to other conditions.
Linking the relative values and importance of issues is key to ensuring
that linked issues gain the attention you require. This is sometimes used
to protect certain terms. For example, if the contract length was very important to one party and they knew that a high-value variable to the other

TACTICS AND VALUES

165

party was attracting a 10,000-volume order, the two would be linked to
ensure that the contract length issues could not be easily dismissed.

This is where some issues are introduced onto the agenda that have been
positioned to lose or trade oﬀ against. Later during the negotiation, value
is traded as each of the red herrings is conceded, having played their part
in attracting improved terms elsewhere. For example, you need to attract
shorter lead times and improved discounts. Both items are on the agenda
as is a new termination clause, allowing you to terminate the contract
with very short notice and lower volume discount thresholds. The last two
are eﬀectively red herrings, which you expect to concede on. However, in
doing so you are able to trade for better terms on lead times and discounts.

This is where you believe that the issue is of high value to the other party
and trade against the issue in “slices.” For example, you know that volume is
critical to them. You are currently at 50,000 units and know that your requirement is for an order of 150,000 units. Rather than trade up to 150,000 units,
you trade to 80,000 in return for a concession. Later you trade to 100,000 for
a further concession, then to 115,000, and so on. Each move is conditional on
a concession, ensuring that the value of your total move is maximized.
7. Deceit

There is no other way to describe this ﬁnal category: deceit. If reputation
or relationships hold any value to you or your business, think twice before

166

using the following. More importantly, be wary of those who carry a different view and choose to use deceit – they may choose to use it on you
even after the contract has been signed.

This is named after a tactic used during the ancient war on Troy, which
led to the saying: “Beware of Greeks bearing gifts.” The Greeks left a gift in
the form of a wooden horse outside Troy. The Trojans accepted the gift and
brought it inside the city only to ﬁnd that the horse was full of soldiers ready to
invade. Beware if the deal appears too good to be true. This relates to the hidden small print, and the conditions and issues that can literally come out of the
woodwork after the deal has been completed. The Trojan horse represents a
package created to entice you. Once accepted, it has some surprises in store
because much of the downside was hidden at the time of agreement.

This is where one party summarizes from their perspective, leaving out or
even adjusting some of the terms discussed earlier. The idea is that you won’t
notice or won’t challenge through fear of jeopardizing progress. Try to ensure
that you summarize progress throughout the meeting and that you do so
from your perspective. Also, ensure that you summarize in writing after the
meeting. If you don’t agree on what you believe you have agreed, then you’re
unlikely to have an agreement that is going to stand the test of time.

So as to open up areas that have already been regarded as concluded,
one party introduces a condition that they know to be unacceptable. After
you have responded with confusion or start to demand clarity they adopt
an “innocent misunderstanding” stance. Their motives could be varied,
but it is usually related to stalling progress or allowing them to try and
renegotiate terms that have otherwise been regarded as closed.

They choose not to understand you at a given time during the negotiation
due to language diﬃculty. This is especially used once the subject of price is
introduced. As they seek to take up a ﬁrm position, they appear increasingly
confused by what you have to say as you attempt to explain your position.
When faced with such behavior, patience, restating your position, and
maybe even a “time out” is needed to dampen their conﬁdence.

This involves one party convincing the other to agree to a deal at highly
preferential rates, which will lead to beneﬁts in the future. These “beneﬁts”
are often not contractual, conditional, or delivered on. In fact they are
often used as a precedent: “You were able to oﬀer that price last time we
worked with you so we know you can do it again.” If you are to enter into
such agreements always ensure that it is in writing and the conditions are
clearly stated in the contract.
KEY TAKEAWAYS

Inﬂuential tactics in negotiation have been used for thousands of years
as a means of gaining leverage and advantage. They can be as subtle as

168

THE NEGOTIATION BOOK

providing misleading information or as blatant as an outright lie. As you
never need to lie in negotiation, many tactics are regarded as a fast route
to destroying trust.

Recognize tactics being used and qualify them by challenging their
consequences.
The type of the tactics you use should be limited to how much trust
and dependency you require in the relationship once the deal is done.
The risk/beneﬁt of employing tactics is something you must judge
based on your own circumstances, objectives, motivation, and values.
More than one tactic at a time will often be combined to increase pressure as others will seek to manipulate your actions.
Performing as a conscious competent negotiator will help increase your
awareness of the tactics in play and will help you recognize, qualify,
challenge, and navigate through the gamesmanship.
